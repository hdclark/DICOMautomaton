## About

`DICOMautomaton` is a multipurpose tool for analyzing *medical physics* data
with a focus on automation. It has first-class support for:

  - images (2D and 3D; CT, MRI, PET, RT dose),
  - surface meshes (2D surfaces embedded in 3D),
  - 2D planar contours embedded in 3D,
  - point clouds (3D),
  - registration and warp transformations (rigid and deformable in 3D),
  - radiotherapy plans, and
  - line samples (i.e., discretized scalar-valued functions over $`\mathbb{R}^1`$).

There are five ways of operating `DICOMautomaton`:

  - command-line interface
    - most flexible, best for automation
    - not interactive, not a repl
  - a minimal graphical interface
    - best for contouring and simple evaluations
    - can be mixed with the command-line interface
  - a terminal graphical interface
    - extremely simplisitic, meant for question-answer interactions
    - can be mixed with the command-line interface
  - web interface
    - supports modal workflow interactions
    - not all operations are supported (e.g., contouring is not currently
      supported)
    - server-client model for off-site/remote installation, can provide
      cross-platform and low-powered client access
  - a scripting interface
    - interactive and integrated editor
    - can be loaded interactively or processed non-interactively

`DICOMautomaton` provides a diverse array of functionality, including
implementations of the following well-known algorithms and analytical
techniques:

    - TSV (write)
  - direct database query (e.g., to interface directly with a PACs)

Customized file formats are provided for snapshotting internal state.

The basic workflow is:

 1. Files are loaded (from a DB or files).

 2. A list of operations are sequentially performed, mutating the data state.

 3. Files of various kinds can be written or a viewer can be invoked. Both
    are implemented as operations that can be chained together sequentially.

Some operations are interactive. Others will run on their own (possibly for days
or even weeks). See [integration\_tests/tests/](integration_tests/tests/) for
specific examples.

Each operation provides a description of the parameters that can be configured.
To see the exact, up-to-date documentation, invoke:

    $>  dicomautomaton_dispatcher -u

and for general information invoke:

    $>  dicomautomaton_dispatcher -h

Alternatively, see [documentation/](documentation/) for documentation snapshots.

## Documentation

Every build of `DICOMautomaton` can generate its own manual, which is provided
in `Markdown` format. After installing, simply issue:

    $>  dicomautomaton_dispatcher -u | more

[See the wiki for tutorials and more information](https://github.com/hdclark/DICOMautomaton/wiki/).

## Clinical Use

`DICOMautomaton` should **NOT** be used for clinical purposes. It is suitable
*only* for research purposes or in a non-critical supporting role where outputs
can be easily validated.

While efforts have been made to verify integrity and validity of the code, no
independent audit or review has been performed. The breadth of functionality
would make it difficult to test all combinations of operations. We therefore
rely on static analysis, code quality metrics, and a limited amount of
integration testing for specific workflows.

## Well-Known Issues

  - The `SFML_Viewer` operation hangs on some systems after viewing a plot with
    `Gnuplot`. This stems from a known issue in `Ygor`.

  - Building with `musl` may cause character conversion to fail for some DICOM
    files in some circumstances.

  - Some operations make use of threading and create filesystem mutexes to avoid
    race conditions. If execution is unexpectedly terminated a mutex may remain
    and stall/hang future operations. This can be resolved by manually removing
    the mutex.

  - If you are limited by an `OpenGL` version earlier than 3.0, for example in a
    `VirtualBox` virtual machine, the `SDL` viewer may fail to load. This can be
    worked around by switching to `Mesa`-based software rendering by configuring
    the entire system or defining the `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` environment
    variable.
