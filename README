About
=====

    DICOMautomaton is a collection of tools for analyzing `medical physics'
  data, specifically dosimetric and medical imaging data in the DICOM format. It
  has become something of a platform that provides a variety of possible
  operations. DICOMautomaton is designed to be easy to develop and the user
  interface is fairly rough. 

    The basic workflow is:
  1. Files are loaded (from a DB or various types of files),
  2. A list of operations are provided and sequentially performed, mutating the
     data state,
  3. Files of various kinds can be written or a viewer can be invoked. (Both
     are implemented as operations that can be chained together sequentially.)

    Some operations are interactive. Others will run on their own for days
  (weeks). Each operation provides a description of the parameters that can be
  configured. To see this documentation, invoke:
        $> dicomautomaton_dispatcher -u
  and for general information invoke:
        $> dicomautomaton_dispatcher -h

    NOTE: DICOMautomaton should NOT be used for clinical purposes. It is 
  suitable for research or support tool purposes only.

Installation
============

  This project uses CMake to build. Use the usual commands to compile:
   $ cd /path/to/source/directory
   $ mkdir build && cd build/
    THEN
     # If by-passing your package manager.
       $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
       $ make && sudo make install
    OR
     # If building for Debian.
       $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
       $ make && make package
       $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
       $ sudo apt-get -f install   # Or [--fix-missing] in lieu of [-f].
    OR
     # If building for Arch Linux.
       $ rsync -a --exclude build ../ ./
       $ makepkg --syncdeps --noconfirm # Optionally also [--install].
