## DICOMautomaton — Guidance for AI coding agents

Be pragmatic and work from concrete, discoverable facts in the repository. This file highlights the project's architecture, developer workflows, conventions, and useful file pointers so an AI agent can be immediately productive!!!

Key constraints (short):
- Primary language: C++17 (large codebase in `src/`). A smaller Python package lives in `py/`.
- Build system: CMake (top-level `CMakeLists.txt`). Many helper scripts live in `scripts/` and top-level helpers (`compile_and_install.sh`, `compile_on.sh`).
- Test harnesses: `integration_tests/Run.sh` and `unit_tests/` provide scripted test runners that expect a built `dicomautomaton_dispatcher` binary in PATH.

Big picture architecture (where to look):
- Core C++ code: `src/` — contains operations, file loaders, viewers, and the dispatcher (`DICOMautomaton_Dispatcher.cc`). Use `src/Documentation.cc` to find user-facing CLI examples.
- CLI entrypoint: `dicomautomaton_dispatcher` (built from `src/`) — operations are invoked via the dispatcher; many examples in `src/Documentation.cc` and the top-level `README.md`.
- Supporting libraries: the repo depends on the author's `Ygor` and `YgorClustering` projects (mentioned in `src/Documentation.cc`) and many external libs (Eigen, CGAL, Boost, SDL2, SFML, WT, nlopt, GSL, libpq, jansson, thrift). Check `CMakeLists.txt` for compile-time options (e.g., `WITH_EIGEN`, `WITH_CGAL`).
- Packaging/portable builds: Docker images and MXE tooling are under `docker/` and `docker/build_bases/`. Top-level scripts create AppImages and portable bundles (`scripts/dump_portable_dcma_bundle.sh`, `scripts/extract_system_appimage.sh`).

Developer workflows & concrete commands:
- Quick local debug build (generic, non-package-managed):
  - mkdir -p build && cd build
  - cmake -DDCMA_VERSION="$(./scripts/extract_dcma_version.sh)" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  - make -j$(nproc)
- Distribution-aware build + install: use `./compile_and_install.sh` (supports `-d arch|debian|mxe|generic`, `-b <buildroot>`, `-i <installprefix>`). This script is the canonical way CI and developers build for different targets.
- Remote or container builds: use `./compile_on.sh user@remote` or the `docker/` builders (examples in `compile_on.sh`).
- Run integration tests (after building): `integration_tests/Run.sh` — it expects `dicomautomaton_dispatcher` available and will copy test artifacts to `dcma_integration_testing`.

Project-specific conventions and patterns:
- Dispatcher & operations pattern: operations are implemented in `src/Operations/` and invoked through the dispatcher. Use `dicomautomaton_dispatcher -u` to print operation parameter descriptions (see `README.md` and `src/Documentation.cc` for examples).
- Ygor usage: many internal types and macros come from `Ygor` (e.g., `YgorMisc.h`, `YgorLog.h`, `YgorMath.h`). When editing code that manipulates core data structures (images, meshes, point clouds), inspect the Ygor headers included in the same files.
- CLI fuzzy selectors: name/label selectors in the dispatcher support fuzzy matching (examples in `src/Documentation.cc`). Tests and examples use patterns like `CT*dcm` or `-o SFML_Viewer`.
- Build flags controlled via CMake: toggles such as `WITH_SFML`, `WITH_SDL`, `WITH_CGAL`, sanitizers (ASAN/TSAN/MSAN), and `MEMORY_CONSTRAINED_BUILD` are used widely — prefer to mirror existing CMake invocations in `compile_and_install.sh` when producing new build instructions.

Integration points & external dependencies to be aware of:
- Ygor and YgorClustering (local include/dependency assumptions). Many source files include `Ygor*.h` headers; ensure they are on the include path when building.
- GUI/viewers: SDL2 (ImGui backends) and SFML are used for interactive viewers (`src/Operations/SDL_Viewer.cc`, `SFML_Viewer.cc`). These expect OpenGL and platform-specific setup (note macOS OpenGL differences in `CMakeLists.txt`).
- Database and RPC: optional components rely on libpq/postgres and Apache Thrift (`WITH_POSTGRES`, `WITH_THRIFT`). If modifying RPC code, consult `src/rpc/` and `src/rpc/DCMA.thrift`.
- Packaging: AppImage generation and portable bundles are used in CI — see `scripts/` and `docker/` for examples; use `compile_and_install.sh` to reproduce packaging steps locally.

Concrete examples to cite when making edits:
- Add or change an operation: mirror structure in `src/Operations/PresentationImage.cc` and register via the dispatcher (see `DICOMautomaton_Dispatcher.cc`).
- Add a new CMake option: follow existing patterns in top-level `CMakeLists.txt` (option(), find_package(), add_definitions). Keep defaults aligned with other options (ON/OFF) and add docs to `src/Documentation.cc` where appropriate.
- Fix viewer rendering issues: inspect `src/Operations/SDL_Viewer.cc` and the ImGui/SDL glue in `src/imgui20210904/` to ensure mouse/GL state handling is consistent.

Quality gates and verification steps (what AI should run):
- After code changes, run a debug build (cmake + make -j) and confirm compilation. Use the same CMake variables developers use in `compile_and_install.sh` for parity.
- Run `integration_tests/Run.sh` for quick functional validation; its scripts are self-contained and copy outputs to `dcma_integration_testing`.
- For smaller changes in `py/`, use `poetry build` or `python -m build` inside `py/` (the `py/pyproject.toml` uses poetry metadata).

What not to assume / common pitfalls:
- Do not assume all optional dependencies are present — `CMakeLists.txt` gates features via `WITH_*` options. Prefer to keep changes backward-compatible when a dependency is absent.
- The project is permissively modular: multiple viewers and backends exist; changing one may require adjusting compile flags or linking (SDL vs SFML).
- Avoid changing public build defaults without updating `compile_and_install.sh` and documentation in `src/Documentation.cc`.

If you need clarification from a human: ask for
- which target platform and build flags to use (e.g., macOS vs Linux, WITH_CGAL=ON),
- whether the change should be packaged (AppImage) or installed system-wide, and
- if Ygor header/library locations need to be adjusted for CI.

Please review and tell me which section should be expanded or any missing commands you want included.
