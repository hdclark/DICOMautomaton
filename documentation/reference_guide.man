.SH Overview
.SS About
.PP
DICOMautomaton is a collection of software tools for processing and
analyzing medical images.
Once a workflow has been developed, the aim of DICOMautomaton is to
require minimal interaction to perform the workflow in an automated way.
However, some interactive tools are also included for workflow
development, exploratory analysis, and contouring.
.PP
DICOMautomaton is meant to be flexible enough to adapt to a wide variety
of situations and has been incorporated into projects to provide: a
local PACs, image analysis for various types of QA, kinetic modeling of
perfusion images, automated fuzzy mapping of ROI names to a standard
lexicon, dosimetric analysis, TCP and NTCP modeling, ROI contour/volume
manipulation, estimation of surface dose, ray casting through patient
and phantom geometry, rudimentary linac beam optimization, radiomics,
and has been used in various ways to explore the relationship between
toxicity and dose in sub-organ compartments.
.PP
Note: DICOMautomaton should \f[B]NOT\f[R] be used for clinical purposes.
It is experimental software.
It is suitable for research or support tool purposes only.
It comes with no warranty or guarantee of any kind, either explicit or
implied.
Users of DICOMautomaton do so fully at their own risk.

.SS dicomautomaton_dispatcher
.SS Description
.PP
The core command-line interface to DICOMautomaton is the
\f[C]dicomautomaton_dispatcher\f[R] program.
It is presents an interface based on chaining of discrete operations on
collections of images, DICOM images, DICOM radiotherapy files (RTSTRUCTS
and RTDOSE), and various other types of files.
\f[C]dicomautomaton_dispatcher\f[R] has access to all defined operations
described in Operations.
It can be used to launch both interactive and non-interactive tasks.
Data can be sourced from a database or files in a variety of formats.
.PP
Name/label selectors in dicomautomaton_dispatcher generally support
fuzzy matching via
libexplicator (https://gitlab.com/hdeanclark/Explicator) or regular
expressions.
The operations and parameters that provide these options are documented
in Operations.
.PP
Filetype support differs in some cases.
A custom FITS file reader and writer are supported, and DICOM files are
generally supported.
There is currently no support for RTPLANs, though DICOM image, RTSTRUCT,
and RTDOSE files are well supported.
There is limited support for writing files \[en] currently JPEG, PNG,
and FITS images; RTDOSE files; and Boost.Serialize archive writing are
supported.

.SS dicomautomaton_webserver
.SS Description
.PP
This web server presents most operations in an interactive web page.
Some operations are disabled by default (e.g., BuildLexiconInteractively
because they are not designed to be operated via remote procedure calls.
This routine should be run within a capability-limiting environment, but
access to an X server is required.
A Docker script is bundled with DICOMautomaton sources which includes
everything needed to function properly.

.SS dicomautomaton_bsarchive_convert
.SS Description
.PP
A program for converting Boost.Serialization archives types which
DICOMautomaton can read.
These archives need to be created by the BoostSerializeDrover operation.
Some archive types are concise and not portable (i.e., binary archives),
or verbose (and thus slow to read and write) and portable (i.e., XML,
plain text).
To combat verbosity, on-the-fly gzip compression and decompression is
supported.
This program can be used to convert archive types.

.SS dicomautomaton_dump
.SS Description
.PP
This program is extremely simplistic.
Given a single DICOM file, it prints to stdout the value of one DICOM
tag.
This program is best used in scripts, for example to check the modality
or a file.
.SS Usage Examples
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dicomautomaton_dump afile.dcm 0x0008 0x0060\f[R]

.SS pacs_ingress
.SS Description
.PP
Given a DICOM file and some additional metadata, insert the data into a
PACs system database.
The file itself will be copied into the database and various bits of
data will be deciphered.
Note that at the moment a `gdcmdump' file must be provided and is stored
alongside the DICOM file in the database filestore.
This sidecar file is meant to support ad-hoc DICOM queries without
having to index the entire file.
Also note that imports into the database are minimal, leaving files with
multiple NULL values.
This is done to improve ingress times.
A separate database refresh (pacs_refresh) must be performed to replace
NULL values.

.SS pacs_duplicate_cleaner
.SS Description
.PP
Given a DICOM file, check if it is in the PACS DB.
If so, delete the file.
Note that a full, byte-by-byte comparison is NOT performed \[en] rather
only the top-level DICOM unique identifiers are (currently) compared.
No other metadata is considered.
So this program is not suitable if DICOM files have been modified
without re-assigning unique identifiers! (Which is non-standard
behaviour.) Note that if an \f[I]exact\f[R] comparison is desired, using
a traditional file de-duplicator will work.

.SH Operations Reference
.SS AccumulateRowsColumns
.SS Description
.PP
This operation generates row- and column-profiles of images in which the
entire row or column has been summed together.
It is useful primarily for detection of axes-aligned edges or ridges.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
It is often useful to pre-process inputs by computing an in-image-plane
derivative, gradient magnitude, or similar (i.e., something to emphasize
edges) before calling this routine.
It is not necessary, however.
.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
ImageSelection
.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS AnalyzeHistograms
.SS Description
.PP
This operation analyzes the selected line samples as if they were
cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs).
Multiple criteria can be specified.
The output is a CSV file that can be concatenated or appended to other
output files to provide a summary of multiple criteria.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will filter out non-matching line samples.
Currently required: Modality=Histogram; each must be explicitly marked
as a cumulative, unscaled abscissa + unscaled ordinate histogram; and
differential distribution statistics must be available (e.g., min, mean,
and max voxel doses).

.SS Constraints
.SS Description
.PP
Constraint criteria that will be evaluated against the selected line
samples.
There three general types of constraints will be recognized.
First, constraints in the style of `Dmax < 50.0 Gy'.
The left-hand-size (LHS) can be any of {Dmin, Dmean, Dmax}.
The inequality can be any of {<, lt, <=, lte, >, gt, >=, gte}.
The right-hand-side (RHS) units can be any of {Gy, %} where `%' means
the RHS number is a percentage of the ReferenceDose.
Second, constraints in the style of `D(coldest 500.0 cc) < 50.4 Gy'.
The inner LHS can be any of {coldest, hottest}.
The inner LHS units can be any of {cc, cm3, cm\[ha]3, %} where `%' means
the inner LHS number is a percentage of the total volume.
The inequality can be any of {<, lt, <=, lte, >, gt, >=, gte}.
The RHS units can be any of {Gy, %} where `%' means the RHS number is a
percentage of the ReferenceDose.
Third, constraints in the style of `V(24.5 Gy) < 500.0 cc'.
The inner LHS units can be any of {Gy, %} where `%' means the inner LHS
number is a percentage of the ReferenceDose.
The inequality can be any of {<, lt, <=, lte, >, gt, >=, gte}.
The RHS units can be any of {cc, cm3, cm\[ha]3, %} where `%' means the
inner LHS number is a percentage of the total volume.
Multiple constraints can be supplied by separating them with `;'
delimiters.
Each will be evaluated separately.
Newlines can also be used, though constraints should all end with a `;'.
Comments can be included by preceeding with a `#', which facilitate
supplying lists of constraints piped in (e.g., from a file via Bash
process substitution).

The absolute dose that relative (i.e., percentage) constraint doses will
be considered against.
Generally this will be the prescription dose (in DICOM units; Gy).
If there are multiple prescriptions, either the prescription appropriate
for the constraint should be supplied, or relative dose constraints
should not be used.

.SS AnalyzeLightRadFieldCoincidence
.SS Description
.PP
This operation analyzes the selected images to compare light and
radiation field coincidence for fixed, symmetric field sizes.
Coincidences are extracted automatically by fitting Gaussians to the
peak nearest to one of the specified field boundaries and comparing
offset from one another.
So, for example, a 10x10cm MLC-defined field would be compared to a
15x15cm field if there are sharp edges (say, metal rulers) that define a
10x10cm field (i.e., considered to represent the light field).
Horizontal and vertical directions (both positive and negative) are all
analyzed separately.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine assumes both fields are squarely aligned with the image
axes.
Alignment need not be perfect, but the Gaussians may be significantly
broadened if there is misalignment.
This should be fixed in a future revision.

It is often useful to pre-process inputs by computing an in-image-plane
derivative, gradient magnitude, or similar (i.e., something to emphasize
edges) before calling this routine.
It may not be necessary, however.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

analyzed at.
For example, if 50x50, 100x100, 150x150, and 200x200 (all in mm) fields
are to be analyzed, this argument would be `50,100,150,200' and it will
be assumed that the field centre is at DICOM position (0,0,0).
All values are in DICOM units.

.SS SearchDistance
.SS Description
.PP
The distance around the anticipated field edges to search for edges
(actually sharp peaks arising from edges).
If an edge is further away than this value from the anticipated field
edge, then the coincidence will be ignored altogether.
The value should be greater than the largest action/tolerance threshold
with some additional margin (so gross errors can be observed), but small
enough that spurious edges (i.e., unintended features in the image, such
as metal fasteners, or artifacts near the field edge) do not replace the
true field edges.
The `sharpness' of the field edge (resulting from the density of the
material used to demarcate the edge) can impact this value; if the edge
is not sharp, then the peak will be shallow, noisy, and may therefore
travel around depending on how the image is pre-processed.
Note that both radiation field and light field edges may differ from the
`nominal' anticipated edges, so this wobble factor should be
incorporated in the search distance.
This quantity must be in DICOM units.

.SS PeakSimilarityThreshold
.SS Description
.PP
Images can be taken such that duplicate peaks will occur, such as when
field sizes are re-used.
Peaks are therefore de-duplicated.
This value (as a %, ranging from [0,100]) specifies the threshold of
disimilarity below which peaks are considered duplicates.
A low value will make duplicates confuse the analysis, but a high value
may cause legitimate peaks to be discarded depending on the attenuation
cababilties of the field edge markers.

.SS AnalyzePicketFence
.SS Description
.PP
This operation extracts MLC positions from a picket fence image.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine requires data to be pre-processed.
The gross picket area should be isolated and the leaf junction areas
contoured (one contour per junction).
Both can be accomplished via thresholding.
Additionally, stray pixels should be filtered out using, for example,
median or conservative filters.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine analyzes the picket fences on the plane in which they are
specified within the DICOM file, which often coincides with the image
receptor (`RTImageSID').
Tolerances are evaluated on the isoplane, so the image is projected
before measuring distances, but the image itself is not altered; a
uniform magnification factor of SAD/SID is applied to all distances.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

.SS Description
.PP
Controls how voxels are deemed to be `within' the interior of the
selected ROI(s).
The default `center' considers only the central-most point of each
voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.
The second, `planar_corner_exclusive', considers a voxel interior if ALL
(four) corners are interior.

.SS CalibCurveFileName
.SS Description
.PP
The file from which a calibration curve should be read from.
The format should be line-based with either 2 or 4 numbers per line.
For 2 numbers: (current pixel value) (new pixel value) and for 4
numbers: (current pixel value) (uncertainty) (new pixel value)
(uncertainty).
Uncertainties refer to the prior number and may be uniformly zero if
unknown.
Lines beginning with `#' are treated as comments and ignored.
The curve is linearly interpolated, and must span the full range of
pixel values.
This is done to avoid extrapolation within the operation since the
correct behaviour will differ depending on the specifics of the
calibration.

.SS Description
.PP
A regular expression (regex) matching \f[I]normalized\f[R] ROI contour
labels/names to consider.
.PP
Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular
expressions or escaping to avoid them.
All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.

.SS Description
.PP
A regular expression (regex) matching \f[I]normalized\f[R] ROI contour
labels/names to consider.
.PP
Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular
expressions or escaping to avoid them.
All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.
Refer to the lexicon for available labels.

.SS SimplificationMethod
.SS Description
.PP
The specific algorithm used to perform contour simplification.
`Vertex removal' is a simple algorithm that removes vertices one-by-one
without replacement.
It iteratively ranks vertices and removes the single vertex that has the
least impact on contour area.
It is best suited to removing redundant vertices or whenever new
vertices should not be added.
`Vertex collapse' combines two adjacent vertices into a single vertex at
their midpoint.
It iteratively ranks vertex pairs and removes the single vertex that has
the least total impact on contour area.
Note that small sharp features that alternate inward and outward will
have a small total area cost, so will be pruned early.
Thus this technique acts as a low-pass filter and will defer
simplification of high-curvature regions until necessary.
It is more economical compared to vertex removal in that it will usually
simplify contours more for a given tolerance (or, equivalently, can
retain contour fidelity better than vertex removal for the same number
of vertices).
However, vertex collapse performs an averaging that may result in
numerical imprecision.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS BEDConvert
.SS Description
.PP
This operation performs Biologically Effective Dose (BED) and Equivalent
Dose with `x'-dose per fraction (EQDx) conversions.
Currently, only photon external beam therapy conversions are supported.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
For an `EQD2' transformation, select an EQDx conversion model with 2 Gy
per fraction (i.e., \f[I]x\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]2).
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation treats all tissue as either early-responding (e.g.,
tumour) or late-responding (e.g., some normal tissues).
A single alpha/beta estimate for each type (early or late) can be
provided.
Currently, only two tissue types can be specified.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation requires specification of the initial number of fractions
and cannot use dose per fraction.
The rationale is that for some models, the dose per fraction would need
to be specified for \f[I]each individual voxel\f[R] since the
prescription dose per fraction is \f[B]not\f[R] the same for voxels
outside the PTV.
.IP \[bu] 2
Be careful in handling the output of a BED calculation.
In particular, BED doses with a given \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R]
should \f[B]only\f[R] be summed with BED doses that have the same
\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R].

.SS Model
.SS Description
.PP
The BED or EQDx model to use.
All assume e was delivered using photon external beam therapy.
Current options are `bed-lq-simple', `eqdx-lq-simple', and
`eqdx-lq-simple-pinned'.
The `bed-lq-simple' model uses a standard linear-quadratic model that
disregards time delays, including repopulation
(\f[I]B\f[R]\f[I]E\f[R]\f[I]D\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004](1\[u2005]+\[u2005]\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R])\f[I]n\f[R]\f[I]d\f[R]).
The `eqdx-lq-simple' model uses the widely-known, standard formula
\f[I]E\f[R]\f[I]Q\f[R]\f[I]D\f[R]~\f[I]x\f[R]~\[u2004]=\[u2004]\f[I]n\f[R]\f[I]d\f[R](\f[I]d\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R])/(\f[I]x\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R])
which is dervied from the linear-quadratic radiobiological model and is
also known as the `Withers' formula.
This model disregards time delays, including repopulation.
The `eqdx-lq-simple-pinned' model is an \f[B]experimental\f[R]
alternative to the `eqdx-lq-simple' model.
The `eqdx-lq-simple-pinned' model implements the `eqdx-lq-simple' model,
but avoids having to specify \f[I]x\f[R] dose per fraction.
First the prescription dose is transformed to EQDx with \f[I]x\f[R] dose
per fraction and the effective number of fractions is extracted.
Then, each voxel is transformed assuming this effective number of
fractions rather than a specific dose per fraction.
This model conveniently avoids having to awkwardly specify \f[I]x\f[R]
dose per fraction for voxels that receive less than \f[I]x\f[R] dose.
It is also idempotent.
Note, however, that the `eqdx-lq-simple-pinned' model produces EQDx
estimates that are \f[B]incompatbile\f[R] with `eqdx-lq-simple' EQDx
estimates.

Control coefficient truncation/pruning to speed up Chebyshev polynomial

The choice of this number depends on how much precision you are willing
to forgo.
It also strongly depends on the number of datum in the AIF, VIF, and the
number of coefficients used to approximate the exponential kernel
(usually \[ti]10 suffices).
Numbers are specified relative to max(N,M), where N and M are the number
of coefficients in the two Chebyshev expansions taking part in the
multiplication.
If too many coefficients are requested (i.e., more than (N+M-2)) then
the full non-approximate multiplication is carried out.

.SS UseBasisSplineInterpolation
.SS Description
.PP
Control whether the AIF and VIF should use basis spline interpolation in
conjunction with the Chebyshev polynomial method.
If this option is not set, linear interpolation is used instead.
Linear interpolation may result in a less-smooth AIF and VIF (and
therefore possibly slower optimizer convergence), but is safer if you
cannot verify the AIF and VIF plots are reasonable.
This option currently produces an effect only if the Chebyshev
polynomial method is being used.

.SS BasisSplineCoefficients
.SS Description
.PP
Control the number of basis spline coefficients to use, if applicable.
(This setting does nothing when basis splines are not being used.) Valid
options for this setting depend on the amount of data and b-spline
order.
This number controls the number of coefficients that are fitted (via
least-squares).
You must verify that overfitting is not happening.
If in doubt, use fewer coefficients.
There are two ways to specify the number: relative and absolute.
Relative means relative to the number of datum.
For example, if the AIF and VIF have \[ti]40 datum then generally
`\f[I]0.5\[cq] is safe. (\[cq]\f[R]0.5' means there are half the number
of coefficients as datum.) Inspect for overfitting and poor fit.
Because this routine happens once and is fast, do not tweak to optimize
for speed; the aim of this method is to produce a smooth and accurate
AIF and VIF.
Because an integer number of coefficients are needed, so rounding is
used.
You can also specify the absolute number of coefficients to use like
`20'.
It often makes more sense to use relative specification.
Be aware that not all inputs can be honoured due to limits on b-spline
knots and breaks, and may cause unpredictable behaviour or internal
failure.

.SS ChebyshevPolyCoefficients
.SS Description
.PP
Control the number of Chebyshev polynomial coefficients to use, if
applicable.
(This setting does nothing when the Chebyshev polynomial method is not
being used.) This number controls the number of coefficients that are
computed.
There are two ways to specify the number: relative and absolute.
Relative means relative to the number of datum.
For example, if the AIF and VIF have \[ti]40 datum then generally
`\f[I]2\[cq] is safe. (\[cq]\f[R]2' means there are 2x the number of
coefficients as datum; usually overkill.) A good middle-ground is
\[cq]*1\[cq] which is faster but should produce similar results.
For speed `/2' is even faster, but can produce bad results in some
cases.
Because an integer number of coefficients are needed, rounding is used.
You can also specify the absolute number of coefficients to use like
`20'.
It often makes more sense to use relative specification.
Be aware that not all inputs can be honoured (i.e., too large, too
small, or negative), and may cause unpredictable behaviour or internal
failure.

.SS FastChebyshevMultiplication
.SS Description
.PP
Control coefficient truncation/pruning to speed up Chebyshev polynomial
multiplication.
(This setting does nothing if the Chebyshev method is not being used.)
The choice of this number depends on how much precision you are willing
to forgo.
It also strongly depends on the number of datum in the AIF, VIF, and the
number of coefficients used to approximate the exponential kernel
(usually \[ti]10 suffices).
Numbers are specified relative to max(N,M), where N and M are the number
of coefficients in the two Chebyshev expansions taking part in the
multiplication.
If too many coefficients are requested (i.e., more than (N+M-2)) then
the full non-approximate multiplication is carried out.

.SS UseBasisSplineInterpolation
.SS Description
.PP
Control whether the AIF and VIF should use basis spline interpolation in
conjunction with the Chebyshev polynomial method.
If this option is not set, linear interpolation is used instead.
Linear interpolation may result in a less-smooth AIF and VIF (and
therefore possibly slower optimizer convergence), but is safer if you
cannot verify the AIF and VIF plots are reasonable.
This option currently produces an effect only if the Chebyshev
polynomial method is being used.

.SS BasisSplineCoefficients
.SS Description
.PP
Control the number of basis spline coefficients to use, if applicable.
(This setting does nothing when basis splines are not being used.) Valid
options for this setting depend on the amount of data and b-spline
order.
This number controls the number of coefficients that are fitted (via
least-squares).
You must verify that overfitting is not happening.
If in doubt, use fewer coefficients.
There are two ways to specify the number: relative and absolute.
Relative means relative to the number of datum.
For example, if the AIF and VIF have \[ti]40 datum then generally
`\f[I]0.5\[cq] is safe. (\[cq]\f[R]0.5' means there are half the number
of coefficients as datum.) Inspect for overfitting and poor fit.
Because this routine happens once and is fast, do not tweak to optimize
for speed; the aim of this method is to produce a smooth and accurate
AIF and VIF.
Because an integer number of coefficients are needed, so rounding is
used.
You can also specify the absolute number of coefficients to use like
`20'.
It often makes more sense to use relative specification.
Be aware that not all inputs can be honoured due to limits on b-spline
knots and breaks, and may cause unpredictable behaviour or internal
failure.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

All members in a cluster must be separated from at least MinPoints
points within a distance of Eps.
There is a standard way to determine an optimal value from the data
itself, but requires generating a k-nearest-neighbours clustering first,
and then visually identifying an appropriate `kink' in the k-distances
plot.
This approach is not implemented here.
Alternatively, the sparsity of the data and the specific problem domain
must be used to estimate a desirable separation Eps.

.SS ComparePixels
.SS Description
.PP
This operation compares images (`test' images and `reference' images) on
a per-voxel/per-pixel basis.
Any combination of 2D and 3D images is supported, including images which
do not fully overlap, but the reference image array must be rectilinear
(this property is verified).
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Images are overwritten, but ReferenceImages are not.
Multiple Images may be specified, but only one ReferenceImages may be
specified.
.IP \[bu] 2
The reference image array must be rectilinear.
(This is a requirement specific to this implementation, a less
restrictive implementation could overcome the issue.)
.IP \[bu] 2
For the fastest and most accurate results, test and reference image
arrays should spatially align.
However, alignment is \f[B]not\f[R] necessary.
If test and reference image arrays are aligned, image adjacency can be
precomputed and the analysis will be faster.
If not, image adjacency must be evaluated for every voxel.
.IP \[bu] 2
The distance-to-agreement comparison will tend to overestimate the
distance, especially when the DTA value is low, because voxel size
effects will dominate the estimation.
Reference images should be supersampled as necessary.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation optionally makes use of interpolation for sub-voxel
distance estimation.
However, interpolation is currently limited to be along the edges
connecting nearest- and next-nearest voxel centres.
In other words, true volumetric interpolation is \f[B]not\f[R]
available.
Implicit interpolation is also used (via the intermediate value theorem)
for the distance-to-agreement comparison, which results in distance
estimation that may vary up to the largest caliper distance of a voxel.
For this reason, the accuracy of all comparisons should be expected to
be limited by image spatial resolution (i.e., voxel dimensions).
Reference images should be supersampled as necessary.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
The comparison method to compute.
Three options are currently available: distance-to-agreement (DTA),
discrepancy, and gamma-index.
All three are fully 3D, but can also work for 2D or mixed 2D-3D
comparisons.
DTA is a measure of how far away the nearest voxel (in the reference
images) is with a voxel intensity sufficiently close to each voxel in
the test images.
This comparison ignores pixel intensities except to test if the values
match within the specified tolerance.
The voxel neighbourhood is exhaustively explored until a suitable voxel
is found.
Implicit interpolation is used to detect when the value could be found
via interpolation, but explicit interpolation is not used.
Thus distance might be overestimated.
A discrepancy comparison measures the point intensity discrepancy
without accounting for spatial shifts.
A gamma analysis combines distance-to-agreement and point differences
into a single index which is best used to test if both DTA and
discrepancy criteria are satisfied (gamma <= 1 iff both pass).
It was proposed by Low et al.\ in 1998 ((doi:10.1118/1.598248).
Gamma analyses permits trade-offs between spatial and dosimetric
discrepancies which can arise when the image arrays slightly differ in
alignment or pixel values.

.SS DTAInterpolationMethod
.SS Description
.PP
Parameter for all comparisons involving a distance-to-agreement (DTA)
search.
Controls how precisely and how often the space between voxel centres are
interpolated to identify the exact position of agreement.
There are currently three options: no interpolation (`None'),
nearest-neighbour (`NN'), and next-nearest-neighbour (`NNN').
(1) If no interpolation is selected, the agreement position will only be
established to within approximately the reference image voxels
dimensions.
To avoid interpolation, voxels that straddle the target value are taken
as the agreement distance.
Conceptually, if you view a voxel as having a finite spatial extent then
this method may be sufficient for distance assessment.
Though it is not precise, it is fast.
This method will tend to over-estimate the actual distance, though it is
possible that it slightly under-estimates it.
This method works best when the reference image grid size is small in
comparison to the desired spatial accuracy (e.g., if computing gamma,
the tolerance should be much larger than the largest voxel dimension) so
supersampling is recommended.
(2) Nearest-neighbour interpolation considers the line connecting
directly adjacent voxels.
Using linear interpolation along this line when adjacent voxels straddle
the target value, the 3D point where the target value appears can be
predicted.
This method can significantly improve distance estimation accuracy,
though will typically be much slower than no interpolation.
On the other hand, this method lower amounts of supersampling, though it
is most reliable when the reference image grid size is small in
comparison to the desired spatial accuracy.
Note that nearest-neighbour interpolation also makes use of the `no
interpolation' methods.
If you have a fine reference image, prefer either no interpolation or
nearest-neighbour interpolation.
(3) Finally, next-nearest-neighbour considers the diagonally-adjacent
neighbours separated by taxi-cab distance of 2 (so in-plane diagonals
are considered, but 3D diagonals are not).
Quadratic (i.e., bi-linear) interpolation is analytically solved to
determine where along the straddling diagonal the target value appears.
This method is more expensive than linear interpolation but will
generally result in more accurate distance estimates.
This method may require lower amounts of supersampling than linear
interpolation, but is most reliable when the reference image grid size
is small in comparison to the desired spatial accuracy.
Use of this method may not be appropriate in all cases considering that
supersampling may be needed and a quadratic equation is solved for every
voxel diagonal.
Note that next-nearest-neighbour interpolation also makes use of the
nearest-neighbour and `no interpolation' methods.

.SS Description
.PP
Parameter for gamma-index comparisons.
Voxel value discrepancies lower than this value are considered
acceptable, but values above will result in gamma values >1.
The specific interpretation of this parameter (and the units) depend on
the specific type of discrepancy used.
For percentage-based discrepancies, this parameter is interpretted as a
percentage (i.e., `5.0' = `5%').
For voxel intensity measures such as the absolute difference, this value
is interpretted as an absolute threshold with the same intensity units
(i.e., `5.0' = `5 HU' or similar).

Note this can parameter can drastically reduce the computational effort
required to compute the gamma index, but the reported gamma values will
be invalid whenever they are >1.
This is often tolerable since the magnitude only matters when it is <1.
In lieu of the true gamma-index, a value slightly >1 will be assumed.

.SS ContourBooleanOperations
.SS Description

This routine performs 2D Boolean operations on user-provided sets of
ROIs.
The ROIs themselves are planar contours embedded in R\[ha]3, but the
Boolean operation is performed once for each 2D plane where the selected
ROIs reside.
This routine can only perform Boolean operations on co-planar contours.
This routine can operate on single contours (rather than ROIs composed
of several contours) by simply presenting this routine with a single
contour to select.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Contour ROI regex matches comprise the sets `A' and `B', as in f(A,B)
where f is the Boolean operation.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine DOES support disconnected ROIs, such as left- and
right-parotid contours that have been joined into a single `parotids'
ROI.
.IP \[bu] 2
Many Boolean operations can produce contours with holes.
This operation currently connects the interior and exterior with a seam
so that holes can be represented by a single polygon (rather than a
separate hole polygon).
It \f[I]is\f[R] possible to export holes as contours with a negative
orientation, but this was not needed when writing.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ContourViaGeometry
.SS Description
.PP
This operation constructs ROI contours using geometrical primitives.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine requires an image array onto which the contours will be
written.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine expects images to be non-overlapping.
In other words, if images overlap then the contours generated may also
overlap.
This is probably not what you want (but there is nothing intrinsically
wrong with presenting this routine with multiple images if you
intentionally want overlapping contours).
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing contours are ignored and unaltered.
.IP \[bu] 2
Small and degenerate contours produced by this routine are suppressed.
If a specific number of contours must be generated, provide a slightly
larger radius to compensate for the degenerate cases at the extrema.

.SS ContourViaThreshold
.SS Description
.PP
This operation constructs ROI contours using images and pixel/voxel
value thresholds.
There are three methods of contour generation available: a simple binary
method in which voxels are either fully in or fully out of the contour,
marching squares (which uses linear interpolation to give smooth
contours), and a method based on 3D marching cubes that will also
provide smooth contours.
The marching cubes method does \f[B]not\f[R] construct a full surface
mesh; rather each individual image slice has their own mesh constructed
in parallel.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine expects images to be non-overlapping.
In other words, if images overlap then the contours generated may also
overlap.
This is probably not what you want (but there is nothing intrinsically
wrong with presenting this routine with multiple images if you
intentionally want overlapping contours).
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing contours are ignored and unaltered.
.IP \[bu] 2
Contour orientation is (likely) not properly handled in this routine, so
`pinches' and holes will produce contours with inconsistent or invalid
topology.
If in doubt, disable merge simplifications and live with the
computational penalty.
The marching cubes approach will properly handle `pinches' and contours
should all be topologically valid.
.IP \[bu] 2
Note that the marching-squares method currently only honours the lower
threshold.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
There are currently three supported methods for generating contours: (1)
a simple (and fast) `binary' inclusivity checker, that simply checks if
a voxel is within the ROI by testing the value at the voxel centre, (2)
the `marching-squares' method, which samples the corners of every voxel
and uses linear interpolation to estimate the threshold value isoline
crossings, and (3) a robust but slow method based on `marching-cubes'.
The binary method is fast, but produces extremely jagged contours.
It may also have problems with `pinches' and topological consistency.
Marching-squares is reasonably fast and general-purpose, and should
produce good quality contours that approximate the threshold value
isocurves to first-order.
It also handles boundaries well by inserting an extra virtual row and
column around the image to ensure contours are all closed.
The marching-cubes method is more robust and should reliably produce
contours for even the most complicated topologies, but is considerably
slower than the binary method.
It may produce worse on boundaries, though otherwise it should produce
the same contours as marching-squares.

.SS SimplifyMergeAdjacent
.SS Description
.PP
Simplify contours by merging adjacent contours.
This reduces the number of contours dramatically, but will cause issues
if there are holes (two contours are generated if there is a single
hole, but most DICOMautomaton code disregards orientation \[en] so the
pixels within the hole will be considered part of the ROI, possibly even
doubly so depending on the algorithm).
Disabling merges is always safe (and is therefore the default) but can
be extremely costly for large images.
Furthermore, if you know the ROI does not have holes (or if you
don\[cq]t care) then it is safe to enable merges.

.SS ContourVote
.SS Description
.PP
This routine pits contours against one another using various criteria.
A number of `closest' or `best' or `winning' contours are copied into a
new contour collection with the specified ROILabel.
The original ROIs are not altered, even the winning ROIs.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation considers individual contours only at the moment.
It could be extended to operate on whole ROIs (i.e.,
contour_collections), or to perform a separate vote within each ROI.
The individual contour approach was taken for relevance in 2D image
(e.g., RTIMAGE) analysis.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation currently cannot perform voting on multiple criteria.
Several criteria could be specified, but an awkward weighting system
would also be needed.

This operation constructs contours for an ROI that encompasses the whole
of all specified images.
It is useful for operations that operate on ROIs whenever you want to
compute something over the whole image.
This routine avoids having to manually contour anything.
The output is `ephemeral' and is not commited to any database.
.SS Notes

Generated contours are tested for intersection with an image before the
image is processed.
.IP \[bu] 2

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ConvertContoursToMeshes
.SS Description
.PP
This routine creates a mesh directly from contours, finding a
correspondence between adjacent contours and `zippering' them together.
Please note that this operation is not robust and should only be
expected to work for simple, sphere-like contours (i.e., convex
polyhedra and mostly-convex polyhedra with only small concavities; see
notes for additional information).
This operation, when it can be used appropriately, should be
significantly faster than meshing via voxelization (e.g., marching
cubes).
It will also insert no additional vertices on the original contour
planes.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine is experimental and currently relies on simple heuristics
to find an adjacent contour correspondence.
.IP \[bu] 2
Meshes sliced on the same planes as the original contours
\f[I]should\f[R] reproduce the original contours (barring numerical
instabilities).
In between the original slices, the mesh may exhibit distortions or
obviously invalid correspondence with adjacent contours.
.IP \[bu] 2
Mesh `pairing' on adjacent slices is evaluated using a mutual overlap
heuristic.
The following adjacent slice pairing scenarios are supported: 1-0, 1-1,
N-0, N-1, and N-M (for any N and M greater than 1).
Adjacent contours with inconsistent orientations will either be
reordered or wholly disregarded.
For N-0, N-1, and N-M pairings all contours in N (and M) are fused using
with a simple distance heuristic; the fusion bridges are extended off
the original contour plane so that mesh slicing will recover the
original contours.
For 1-0 and N-0 pairings the `hole' is filled by placing a single vertex
offset from the occupied contour plane from the centroid and connecting
all vertices; mesh slicing should also recover the original contours in
this case.
.IP \[bu] 2
Overlapping contours \f[B]on the same plane\f[R] are \f[B]not\f[R]
currently supported.
Only the contour with the largest area will be retained.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine should only be expected to work for simple, sphere-like
geometries (i.e., convex polyhedra).
Some concavities can be tolerated, but not all.
For example, tori can only be meshed if the `hole' is oriented away from
the contour normal.
(Otherwise the `hole' produces concentric contours \[en] which are not
supported.) Contours representing convex polyhedra \f[B]should\f[R]
result in manifold meshes, though they may not be watertight and if
contour vertices are degenerate (or too close together numerically)
meshes will fail to remain manifold.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
The conversion method to use.
Two options are available: `vertices' and `centroid'.
The `vertices' option extracts all vertices from all selected contours
and directly inserts them into the new point cloud.
Point clouds created this way will contain as many points as there are
contour vertices.
The `centroid' option finds the centroid of all vertices from all
selected contours.
Note that the centroid gives every point an equal weighting, so
heterogeneous contour vertex density will shift the position of the
centroid (unless the distribution is symmetric about the centroid, which
should roughly be the case for spherical contour collections).
Point clouds created this way will contain a single point.

.SS ConvertImageToMeshes
.SS Description
.PP
This operation extracts surface meshes from images and pixel/voxel value
thresholds.
Meshes are appended to the back of the Surface_Mesh stack.
There are two methods of contour generation available: a simple binary
method in which voxels are either fully in or fully out of the contour,
and a method based on marching cubes that will provide smoother
contours.
Both methods make use of marching cubes \[en] the binary method involves
pre-processing.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
There are currently two supported methods for generating contours: (1) a
simple (and fast) binary inclusivity checker, that simply checks if a
voxel is within the ROI by testing the value at the voxel centre, and
(2) a robust (but slow) method based on marching cubes.
The binary method is fast, but produces extremely jagged contours.
It may also have problems with `pinches' and topological consistency.
The marching method is more robust and should reliably produce contours
for even the most complicated topologies, but is considerably slower
than the binary method.

The conversion method to use.
Two options are currently available: `vertices' and `random'.
The `vertices' option extracts all vertices from all selected meshes and
directly inserts them into the new point cloud.
Point clouds created this way will contain as many points as there are
mesh vertices.
The `random' option samples the surface mesh uniformly.
The likelihood of specific a face being sampled is proportional to its
area.
This method requires a target sample density, which determines the
number of samples taken; this density is an average over the entire mesh
surface area, and individual samples may have less or more separation
from neighbouring samples.
Note that the `random' method will tend to result in clusters of samples
and pockets without samples.
This is unavoidable when sampling randomly.
The `random' method accepts two parameters: a pseudo-random number
generator seed and the desired sample density.

.SS Description
.PP
The upper bound (inclusive).
Pixels with values > this number are excluded from the ROI.
If the number is followed by a `%', the bound will be scaled between the
min and max pixel values [0-100%].
If the number is followed by `tile', the bound will be replaced with the
corresponding percentile [0-100tile].
Note that upper and lower bounds can be specified separately (e.g.,
lower bound is a percentage, but upper bound is a percentile).

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ConvolveImages
.SS Description
.PP
This routine convolves, correlates, or pattern-matches one rectilinear
image array with another in voxel number space (i.e., the DICOM
coordinate system of the convolution kernel image is entirely
disregarded).
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Both provided image arrays must be rectilinear.
In many instances they should both be regular, not just rectilinear, but
rectilinearity is sufficient for constructing voxel-by-voxel adjacency
relatively quickly, and some applications may require rectilinear
kernels to be supported, so rectilinear inputs are permitted.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation can be used to apply arbitrary convolution kernels to an
image array.
It can also be used to search for instances of one image array in
another.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the magnitude of the outgoing voxels will be interpretted in absolute
(i.e., thresholding based on an absolute magnitude) then the kernel
should be weighted so that the sum of all kernel voxel intensities is
zero.
This will maintain the average voxel intensity.
However, for pattern matching the kernel need not be normalized (though
it may make interpretting partial matches easier.)

.SS Operation
.SS Description
.PP
Controls the way the kernel is applied and the reduction is tallied.
Currently, `convolution', `correlation', and `pattern-match' are
supported.
For convolution, the reference image is spatially inverted along row-,
column-, and image-axes.
The outgoing voxel intensity is the inner (i.e., dot) product of the
paired intensities of the surrounding voxel neighbourhood (i.e., the
voxel at (-1,3,0) from the centre of the kernel is paired with the
neighbouring voxel at (-1,3,0) from the current/outgoing voxel).
For pattern-matching, the difference between the kernel and each
voxel\[cq]s neighbourhood voxels is compared using a 2-norm (i.e.,
Euclidean) cost function.
With this cost function, a perfect, pixel-for-pixel match (i.e., if the
kernel images appears exactly in the image being transformed) will
result in the outgoing voxel having zero intensity (i.e., zero cost).
For correlation, the kernel is applied as-is (just like
pattern-matching), but the inner product of the paired voxel
neighbourhood intensities is reported (just like convolution).
In all cases the kernel is (approximately) centred.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').

.SS NormalizedROILabelRegex
.SS Description
.PP
A regular expression (regex) matching \f[I]normalized\f[R] ROI contour
labels/names to consider.
.PP
Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular
expressions or escaping to avoid them.
All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.

.SS Inclusivity
.SS Description
.PP
Controls how voxels are deemed to be `within' the interior of the
selected ROI(s).
The default `center' considers only the central-most point of each
voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.
The second, `planar_corner_exclusive', considers a voxel interior if ALL
(four) corners are interior.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

.SS Description
.PP
This operation provides a simplified interface for overriding voxel
values outside a ROI.
For example, this operation can be used to modify a base plan by
eliminating dose outside an OAR.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation performs the opposite of the `Trim' operation, which
trims voxel values \f[B]inside\f[R] a ROI.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
This will effectively honour only the outermost contour regardless of
orientation, but provides the most predictable and consistent results.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
This is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
If contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours intersect)
the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and
alternately cancerls all overlapping contours.
Again, if the contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours
intersect) the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.

.SS Inclusivity
.SS Description
.PP
Controls how voxels are deemed to be `within' the interior of the
selected ROI(s).
The default `center' considers only the central-most point of each
voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.
The second, `planar_corner_exclusive', considers a voxel interior if ALL
(four) corners are interior.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
Controls the type of image mask that is generated.
The default, `binary', exclusively overwrites voxels with the
InteriorValue or ExteriorValue.
Another method is `receding_squares' which creates a mask which, if
processed with the marching-squares algorithm, will (mostly) recreate
the original contours.
The `receding_squares' can be considered the inverse of the
marching-squares algorithm.
Note that the `receding_squares' implementation is not optimized for
speed.

average (`baseline') from later images (and then possibly/optionally
averaging relative to the baseline).
.SS Notes

Only a single image volume is required.
It is expected to have temporal sampling beyond the contrast injection
timepoint (or some default value \[en] currently around \[ti]30s).
The resulting images retain the baseline portion, so you\[cq]ll need to
trim yourself if needed.
.IP \[bu] 2

Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based

.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').

.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and

.SS DecayDoseOverTimeHalve
.SS Description
.PP
This operation transforms a dose map (assumed to be delivered some
distant time in the past) to simulate `decay' or `evaporation' or
`forgivance' of radiation dose by simply halving the value.
This model is only appropriate at long time-scales, but there is no
cut-off or threshold to denote what is sufficiently `long'.
So use at your own risk.
As a rule of thumb, do not use this routine if fewer than 2-3y have
elapsed.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will combine spatially-overlapping images by summing voxel
intensities.
So if you have a time course it may be more sensible to aggregate images
in some way (e.g., spatial averaging) prior to calling this routine.
.IP \[bu] 2
Since this routine is meant to be applied multiple times in succession
for different ROIs (which possibly overlap), all images are imbued with
a second channel that is treated as a mask.
Mask channels are permanently attached so that multiple passes will not
erroneously decay dose.
If this will be problematic, the extra column should be trimmed
immediately after calling this routine.

Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular

All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.

.SS ToleranceTotalDose
.SS Description

The dose delivered (in Gray) for a hypothetical `lifetime dose

corresponds to the toxicity of interest.
For CNS tissues, it will probably be myelopathy or necrosis at some
population-level onset risk (e.g., 5% risk of myelopathy).
The value provided will be converted to a BED_{a/b} so you can safely
provide a `nominal' value.
Be aware that each voxel is treated independently, rather than treating
OARs/ROIs as a whole.
(Many dose limits reported in the literature use whole-ROI D_mean or
D_max, and so may be not be directly applicable to per-voxel risk
estimation!) Note that the QUANTEC 2010 reports almost all assume 2
Gy/fraction.
If several fractionation schemes were used, you should provide a
cumulative BED-derived dose here.

ImageSelection
.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP

time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.

In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').

.SS DetectGrid3D
.SS Description
.PP
This routine fits a 3D grid to a point cloud using a Procrustes analysis
with point-to-model correspondence estimated via an iterative closest
point approach.
A RANSAC-powered loop is used to (1) randomly select a subset of the
grid for coarse iterative closest point grid fitting, and then (2) use
the coarse fit results as a guess for the whole point cloud in a
refinement stage.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Traditional Procrustes analysis requires a priori point-to-point
correspondence knowledge.
Because this operation fits a model (with infinite extent),
point-to-point correspondence is not known and the model is effectively
an infinite continuum of potential points.
To overcome this problem, correspondence is estimated by projecting each
point in the point cloud onto every grid line and selecting the closest
projected point.
The point cloud point and the project point are then treated as
corresponding points.
Using this phony correspondence, the Procrustes problem is solved and
the grid is reoriented.
This is performed iteratively.
However \f[B]there is no guarantee the procedure will converge\f[R] and
furthermore, even if it does converge, \f[B]there is no guarantee that
the grid will be appropriately fit\f[R].
The best results will occur when the grid is already closely aligned
with the point cloud (i.e., when the first guess is very close to a
solution).
If this cannot be guaranteed, it may be advantageous to have a nearly
continuous point cloud to avoid gaps in which the iteration can get
stuck in a local minimum.
For this reason, RANSAC is applied to continuously reboot the fitting
procedure.
All but the best fit are discarded.
.IP \[bu] 2
A two-stage RANSAC inner-loop iterative closest point fitting procedure
is used.
Coarse grid fitting is first performed with a limited subset of the
whole point cloud.
This is followed with a refinment stage in which the enire point cloud
is fitted using an initial guess carried forward from the coarse fitting
stage.
This guess is expected to be reasonably close to the true grid in cases
where the coarse fitting procedure was not tainted by outliers, but is
only derived from a small portion of the point cloud.
(Thus RANSAC is used to perform this coarse-fine iterative procedure
multiple times to provide resilience to poor-quality coarse fits.)
CoarseICPMaxLoops is the maximum number of iterative-closest point loop
iterations performed during the coarse grid fitting stage (on a subset
of the point cloud), and FineICPMaxLoops is the maximum number of
iterative-closest point loop iterations performed during the refinement
stage (using the whole point cloud).
Note that, depending on the noise level and number of points considered
(i.e., whether the RANSACDist parameter is sufficiently small to avoid
spatial wrapping of corresponding points into adjacent grid cells, but
sufficiently large to enclose at least one whole grid cell), the coarse
phase should converge within a few iterations.
However, on each loop a single point is selected as the grid\[cq]s
rotation centre.
This means that a few extra iterations should always be used in case
outliers are selected as rotation centres.
Additionally, if the point cloud is dense or there are lots of outliers
present, increase CoarseICPMaxLoops to ensure there is a reasonable
chance of selecting legitimate rotation points.
On the other hand, be aware that the coarse-fine iterative procedure is
performed afresh for every RANSAC loop, and RANSAC loops are better able
to ensure the point cloud is sampled ergodically.
It might therefore be more productive to increase the RANSACMaxLoops
parameter and reduce the number of CoarseICPMaxLoops.
FineICPMaxLoops should converge quickly if the coarse fitting stage was
representative of the true grid.
However, as in the coarse stage a rotation centre is nominated in each
loop, so it will be a good idea to keep a sufficient number of loops to
ensure a legitimate and appropriate non-outlier point is nominated
during this stage.
Given the complicated interplay between parameters and stages, it is
always best to tune using a representative sample of the point cloud you
need to fit!

.SS RANSACDist
.SS Description
.PP
Every iteration of RANSAC selects a single point from the point cloud.
Only the near-vicinity of points are retained for
iterative-closest-point Procrustes solving.
This parameter determines the maximum radial distance from the RANSAC
point within which point cloud points will be retained; all points
further than this distance away will be pruned for a given round of
RANSAC.
This is needed because corresponding points begin to alias to incorrect
cell faces when the ICP procedure begins with a poor guess.
Pruning points in a spherical neighbourhood with a diameter 2-4x the
GridSeparation (so a radius 1-2x GridSeparation) will help mitigate
aliasing even when the initial guess is poor.
However, smaller windows may increase susceptibility to noise/outliers,
and RANSACDist should never be smaller than a grid voxel.
If RANSACDist is not provided, a default of (1.5 * GridSeparation) is
used.

.SS DetectShapes3D
.SS Description
.PP
This operation attempts to detect shapes in image volumes.
.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
ImageSelection
.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS NormalizedROILabelRegex
.SS Description
.PP
A regular expression (regex) matching \f[I]normalized\f[R] ROI contour

.PP
Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular
expressions or escaping to avoid them.
All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.

.SS Shapes
.SS Description
.PP
This parameter is used to specify the shapes and patterns to consider.
Currently grids, wireframecubes, and solidspheres are available.
Grids have four configurable parameters: two orientation unit vectors,
line thickness, and line separation.
A grid intersecting at the image array\[cq]s centre, aligned with
(1.0,0.0,0.0) and (0.0,1.0,0.0), with line thickness (i.e., diameter)
3.0 (DICOM units; mm), and separation 15.0 can be specified as
`grid(1.0,0.0,0.0, 0.0,1.0,0.0, 3.0, 15.0)'.
Unit vectors will be Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized.
Note that currently the grid \f[I]must\f[R] intersect the image
array\[cq]s centre.
Cubes have the same number of configurable parameters, but only a single
cube of the grid is drawn.
The wireframecube is centred at the image centre, rather than
intersecting it.
Solid spheres have two configurable parameters: a centre vector and a
radius.
A solid sphere at (1.0,2.0,3.0) with radius 15.0 (all DICOM units; mm)
can be specified as `solidsphere(1.0,2.0,3.0, 15.0)'.
Grid, wireframecube, and solidsphere shapes only overwrite voxels that
intersect the geometry (i.e., the surface if hollow or the internal
volume if solid) permitting easier composition of multiple shapes or
custom backgrounds.

.SS DumpImageMeshes
.SS Description
.PP
This operation exports images as a 3D surface mesh model (structured
ASCII Wavefront OBJ) that can be manipulated in various ways (e.g.,
stereographic projection).
Note that the mesh will be a 3D depiction of the image(s) as they
naturally are \[en] meshes will always be rectangular.
A companion material library file (MTL) assigns colours to each ROI
based on the voxel intensity.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Each image is processed separately.
Each mesh effectively produces a 2D relief map embedded into a 3D model
that can be easily rendered to produce various effects (e.g.,
perspective, stereoscopy, extrusion, surface smoothing, etc.).

.SS Description

The number of equal-width bins pixel intensities should be grouped into.
Binning is performed in order to more easily associate material
properties with pixels.
If pixel intensities were continuous, each pixel would receive its own
material definition.
This could result in enormous MTL files and wasted disk space.
Binning solves this issue.
However, if images are small or must be differentiated precisely
consider using a large number of bins.
Otherwise 150-1000 bins should suffice for display purposes.

.SS MagnitudeAmplification
.SS Description
.PP
Pixel magnitudes (i.e., intensities) are scaled according to the image
thickness, but a small gap is left between meshes so that abutting
images do not quite intersect (this can cause non-manifold scenarios).
However, if stackability is not a concern then pixel magnitudes can be
magnified to exaggerate the relief effect.
A value of 1.0 provides no magnification.
A value of 2.0 provides 2x magnification, but note that the base of each
pixel is slightly offset from the top to avoid top-bottom face
intersections, even when magnification is 0.0.

.SS Description
.PP
This parameter controls whether the model will be `normalized,' which
effectively makes the outgoing model more consistent for all images.
Currently this means centring the model at (0,0,0), mapping the row and
column directions to (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) respectively, and scaling the
image (respecting the aspect ratio) to fit within a bounding square of
size 100x100 (DICOM units; mm).

spatial characteristics of the image it is derived from.

.SS DumpROIContours
.SS Description
.PP
This operation exports contours in a standard surface mesh format
(structured ASCII Wavefront OBJ) in planar polygon format.
A companion material library file (MTL) assigns colours to each ROI to
help differentiate them.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Contours that are grouped together into a contour_collection are treated
as a logical within the output.
For example, all contours in a collection will share a common material
property (e.g., colour).
If more fine-grained grouping is required, this routine can be called
once for each group which will result in a logical grouping of one ROI
per file.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description

Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

.SS TPlanSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more treatment plans.
Note that a single treatment plan may be composed of multiple beams; if
delivered sequentially, they should collectively represent a single
logically cohesive plan.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth treatment
plan (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last treatment plan.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the treatment plan composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all treatment plan that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous treatment plan

.SS EvaluateDoseVolumeStats
.SS Description
.PP
This operation evaluates a variety of Dose-Volume statistics.
It is geared toward PTV ROIs.
Currently the following are implemented: (1) Dose Homogeneity Index: H =
(D_{2%} - D_{98%})/D_{median} | over one or more PTVs, where D_{2%} is
the maximum dose that covers 2% of the volume of the PTV, and D_{98%} is
the minimum dose that covers 98% of the volume of the PTV.
(2) Conformity Number: C = V_{T,pres}\[ha]{2} / ( V_{T} * V_{pres} )
where V_{T,pres} is the PTV volume receiving at least 95% of the PTV
prescription dose, V_{T} is the volume of the PTV, and V_{pres} is
volume of all (tissue) voxels receiving at least 95% of the PTV
prescription dose.

Currently the following are implemented: (1) The LKB model.
(2) The `Fenwick' model for solid tumours (in the lung; for a whole-lung
OAR).
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Generally these models require dose in 2 Gy per fraction equivalents
(`EQD2').
You must pre-convert the data if the RT plan is not already 2 Gy per
fraction.
There is no easy way to ensure this conversion has taken place or was
unnecessary.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will combine spatially-overlapping images by summing voxel

The LKB and mEUD both have their own gEUD `alpha' parameter, but they
are not necessarily shared.
Huang et al.\ 2015 (doi:10.1038/srep18010) used alpha=1 for the LKB

The weighting factor \f[I]\[*a]\f[R] that controls the relative
weighting of volume and dose in the generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose
(gEUD) model.
When \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1, the gEUD is equivalent to the
mean; when \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]0, the gEUD is equivalent to
the geometric mean.
Wu et al.\ (doi:10.1016/S0360-3016(01)02585-8) claim that for normal
tissues, \f[I]\[*a]\f[R] can be related to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman
(LKB) model volume parameter `n' via
\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1/\f[I]n\f[R].
Sovik et al.
(doi:10.1016/j.ejmp.2007.09.001) found that gEUD is not strongly
impacted by errors in \f[I]\[*a]\f[R].
Niemierko et al.\ (`A generalized concept of equivalent uniform dose.
Med Phys 26:1100, 1999) generated maximum likelihood estimates for
\[cq]several tumors and normal structures' which ranged from -13.1 for
local control of chordoma tumors to +17.7 for perforation of esophagus.
Gay et al.\ (doi:10.1016/j.ejmp.2007.07.001) table 2 lists estimates
based on the work of Emami (doi:10.1016/0360-3016(91)90171-Y) for normal
tissues ranging from 1-31.
Brenner et al.
(doi:10.1016/0360-3016(93)90189-3) recommend -7.2 for breast cancer, -10
for melanoma, and -13 for squamous cell carcinomas.
A 2017 presentation by Ontida Apinorasethkul claims the tumour range
spans [-40:-1] and the organs at risk range spans [1:40].
AAPM TG report 166 also provides a listing of recommended values,
suggesting -10 for PTV and GTV, +1 for parotid, 20 for spinal cord, and
8-16 for rectum, bladder, brainstem, chiasm, eye, and optic nerve.
Burman (1991) and QUANTEC (2010) also provide estimates.

The Fenwick and Martel models share the value of D_{50}.
There may be a slight difference in some cases.
Huang et al.
2015 (doi:10.1038/srep18010) used both models and used 84.5 Gy for the
Martel model while using 84.6 Gy for the Fenwick model.
(The paper also reported using a Fenwick `m' of 0.329 whereas the
original report by Fenwick reported 0.392, so I don\[cq]t think this
should be taken as strong evidence of the equality of D_{50}.
However, the difference seems relatively insignificant.)

.SS Gamma50
.SS Description
.PP
The unitless `normalized dose-response gradient' or normalized slope of
the logistic dose-response model at the half-maximum point (e.g., D_50).
Informally, this parameter controls the steepness of the dose-response
curve.
(For more specific information, consult a standard reference such as
`Basic Clinical Radiobiology' 4th Edition by Joiner et al., sections
5.3-5.5.) This parameter is empirically fit and not universal.
Late endpoints for normal tissues have gamma_50 around 2-6 whereas
gamma_50 nominally varies around 1.5-2.5 for local control of squamous
cell carcinomas of the head and neck.

.SS Dose50
.SS Description

The dose (in Gray) needed to achieve 50% probability of local tumour
control according to an empirical logistic dose-response model (e.g.,
D_50).
Informally, this parameter `shifts' the model along the dose axis.
(For more specific information, consult a standard reference such as
`Basic Clinical Radiobiology' 4th Edition by Joiner et al., sections
5.1-5.3.) This parameter is empirically fit and not universal.
In `Quantifying the position and steepness of radiation dose-response
curves' by Bentzen and Tucker in 1994, D_50 of around 60-65 Gy are
reported for local control of head and neck cancers (pyriform sinus
carcinoma and neck nodes with max diameter <= 3cm).

.SS EUD_Gamma50
.SS Description
.PP
The unitless `normalized dose-response gradient' or normalized slope of
the gEUD TCP model.
It is defined only for the generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD)
model.
This is sometimes referred to as the change in TCP for a unit change in
dose straddled at the TCD_50 dose.
It is a counterpart to the Martel model\[cq]s `Gamma_50' parameter, but
is not quite the same.
Okunieff et al.\ (doi:10.1016/0360-3016(94)00475-Z) computed Gamma50 for
tumours in human subjects across multiple institutions; they found a
median of 0.8 for gross disease and a median of 1.5 for microscopic
disease.
The inter-quartile range was [0.7:1.8] and [0.7:2.2] respectively.
(Refer to table 3 for site-specific values.) Additionally, Gay et
al.\ (doi:10.1016/j.ejmp.2007.07.001) claim that a value of 4.0 for late
effects a value of 2.0 for tumors in `are reasonable initial estimates
in [our] experience.' Their table 2 lists (NTCP) estimates based on the

more like a per voxel TCP-weighted mean.) Okunieff et
al.\ (doi:10.1016/0360-3016(94)00475-Z) computed TCD50 for tumours in
human subjects across multiple institutions; they found a median of 51.9

.SS EUD_Alpha
.SS Description
.PP
The weighting factor \f[I]\[*a]\f[R] that controls the relative
weighting of volume and dose in the generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose
(gEUD) model.
When \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1, the gEUD is equivalent to the
mean; when \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]0, the gEUD is equivalent to
the geometric mean.
Wu et al.\ (doi:10.1016/S0360-3016(01)02585-8) claim that for normal
tissues, \f[I]\[*a]\f[R] can be related to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman
(LKB) model volume parameter `n' via
\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1/\f[I]n\f[R].
Sovik et al.
(doi:10.1016/j.ejmp.2007.09.001) found that gEUD is not strongly
impacted by error in \f[I]\[*a]\f[R].
Niemierko et al.\ (`A generalized concept of equivalent uniform dose.
Med Phys 26:1100, 1999) generated maximum likelihood estimates for
\[cq]several tumors and normal structures' which ranged from -13.1 for
local control of chordoma tumors to +17.7 for perforation of esophagus.
Gay et al.\ (doi:10.1016/j.ejmp.2007.07.001) table 2 lists estimates
based on the work of Emami (doi:10.1016/0360-3016(91)90171-Y) for normal
tissues ranging from 1-31.
Brenner et al.
(doi:10.1016/0360-3016(93)90189-3) recommend -7.2 for breast cancer, -10
for melanoma, and -13 for squamous cell carcinomas.
A 2017 presentation by Ontida Apinorasethkul claims the tumour range
spans [-40:-1] and the organs at risk range spans [1:40].
AAPM TG report 166 also provides a listing of recommended values,
suggesting -10 for PTV and GTV, +1 for parotid, 20 for spinal cord, and
8-16 for rectum, bladder, brainstem, chiasm, eye, and optic nerve.
Burman (1991) and QUANTEC (2010) also provide estimates.

.SS Description

This parameter describes the degree that superlinear doses are required
to control large tumours.
In other words, as tumour volume grows, a disproportionate amount of
additional dose is required to maintain the same level of control.
The Fenwick model is semi-empirical, so this number must be fitted or
used from values reported in the literature.
Fenwick et al.\ 2008 (doi:10.1016/j.clon.2008.12.011) provide values:
9.58 for local progression free survival at 30 months for NSCLC tumours
and 5.00 for head-and-neck tumours.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP

Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS MeshSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more surface meshes.
Note that a single surface mesh may hold many disconnected mesh
components; they should collectively represent a single logically
cohesive object.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated sub-meshes
together in a single mesh.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth surface
mesh (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last surface mesh.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the surface mesh composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all surface mesh that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous surface mesh
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Support for metadata in OFF files is currently limited.
Metadata will generally be lost.
.IP \[bu] 2
OFF files can contain many different types of geometry, and some

.SS ExportSurfaceMeshesSTL
.SS Description
.PP
This operation writes one or more surface meshes to file in the (3D
Systems) Stereolithography format.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Support for metadata in STL files is currently limited.
Metadata will generally be lost.
.IP \[bu] 2
The STL format is generally meant to be sent to hardware with limited
processing power or memory, and is pre-processed so that individual
faces can be easily streamed.
This pre-processing destroys information about the mesh, for example
face adjacency.
This information can be hard or impossible to fully recover.
If you need to later process, or re-process a surface mesh, avoid the
STL file format if possible.
Alternatives supported by DICOMautomaton include PLY, OBJ, and OFF
formats.

biologically-equivalent dose
(\f[I]B\f[R]\f[I]E\f[R]\f[I]D\f[R]~\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R]~)
transformed array or an equivalent dose in \f[I]d\f[R] dose per fraction
(\f[I]E\f[R]\f[I]Q\f[R]\f[I]D\f[R]~\f[I]x\f[R]~) array and a `reference'
untransformed array.
The \f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R] used for each voxel are extracted by
comparing corresponding voxels.
Each voxel is overwritten with the value of
\f[I]\[*a]\f[R]/\f[I]\[*b]\f[R] needed to accomplish the given
transform.
This routine is best used to inspect a given transformation (e.g., for
QA purposes).
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Images are overwritten, but ReferenceImages are not.
Multiple Images may be specified, but only one ReferenceImages may be
specified.
.IP \[bu] 2
The reference image array must be rectilinear.
(This is a requirement specific to this implementation, a less
restrictive implementation could overcome the issue.)
.IP \[bu] 2
For the fastest and most accurate results, test and reference image
arrays should spatially align.
However, alignment is \f[B]not\f[R] necessary.
If test and reference image arrays are aligned, image adjacency can be
precomputed and the analysis will be faster.
If not, image adjacency must be evaluated for each image slice.
If this also fails, it will be evaluated for every voxel.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation will make use of interpolation if corresponding voxels do
not exactly overlap.

.SS ExtractImageHistograms
.SS Description
.PP
This operation extracts histograms (e.g., dose-volume \[en] DVH, or
pixel intensity-volume) for the selected image(s) and ROI(s).
Results are stored as line samples for later analysis or export.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine generates differential histograms with unscaled abscissae
and ordinate axes.
It also generates cumulative histograms with unscaled abscissae and
\f[I]both\f[R] unscaled and peak-normalized-to-one ordinates.
Unscaled abscissa are reported in DICOM units (typically HU or Gy),
unscaled ordinates are reported in volumetric DICOM units (mm^3^), and
normalized ordinates are reported as a fraction of the given ROI\[cq]s
total volume.
.IP \[bu] 2
Non-finite voxels are excluded from analysis and do not contribute to
the volume.
If exact volume is required, ensure all voxels are finite prior to
invoking this routine.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine can handle contour partitions where the physical layout
(i.e., storage order) differs from the logical layout.
See the `grouping' options for available configuration.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will correctly handle non-overlapping voxels with varying
volumes (i.e., rectilinear image arrays).
It will \f[I]not\f[R] correctly handle overlapping voxels (i.e., each
overlapping voxel will be counted without regard for overlap).
If necessary, resample image arrays to be rectilinear.

.SS Grouping
.SS Description
.PP
This routine partitions individual contours using their ROI labels.
This parameter controls whether contours with different names should be
treated as though they belong to distinct logical groups (`separate') or
whether \f[I]all\f[R] contours should be treated as though they belong
to a single logical group (`combined').
The `separate' option works best for exploratory analysis, extracting
histograms for many OARs at once, or when you know the `physical'
grouping of contours by label reflects a consistent logical grouping.
The `combined' option works best when the physical and logical groupings
are inconsistent.
For example, when you need a combined histograms from multiple contours
or organs, or when similar structures should be combined (e.g., spinal
cord + canal; or distinct left + right lateral organs that should be
paired, e.g..
`combined parotids').
Note that when the `combined' option is used, the `GroupLabel' parameter

.SS ExtractPointsWarp
.SS Description
.PP
This operation uses two point clouds (one `moving' and the other
`stationary' or `reference') to find a transformation (`warp') that will
map the moving point set to the stationary point set.
The resulting transformation encapsulates a `registration' between the
two point sets \[en] however the transformation is generic and can be
later be used to move (i.e., `warp', `deform') other objects, including
the `moving' point set.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
The `moving' point cloud is \f[I]not\f[R] warped by this operation \[en]
this operation merely identifies a suitable transformation.
Separation of the identification and application of a warp allows the
warp to more easily re-used and applied to multiple objects.
.IP \[bu] 2
The output of this operation is a transformation that can later be
applied, in principle, to point clouds, surface meshes, images,
arbitrary vector fields, and any other objects in \f[I]R\f[R]^3^.
.IP \[bu] 2
There are multiple algorithms implemented.
Some do \f[I]not\f[R] provide bijective mappings, meaning that swapping
the inputs will result in an altogether different registration (even
after inverting it).

.SS MovingPointSelection
.SS Description
.PP
The point cloud that will serve as input to the warp function.
Select one or more point clouds.
Note that point clouds can hold a variety of data with varying
attributes, but each point cloud is meant to represent a single
logically cohesive collection of points.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated points together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth point
cloud (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last point cloud.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the point cloud composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all point cloud that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous point cloud
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
The alignment algorithm to use.
The following alignment options are available: `centroid', `PCA',
`exhaustive_icp', `TPS', and `TPS-RPM'.
The `centroid' option finds a rotationless translation the aligns the
centroid (i.e., the centre of mass if every point has the same `mass')
of the moving point cloud with that of the stationary point cloud.
It is susceptible to noise and outliers, and can only be reliably used
when the point cloud has complete rotational symmetry (i.e., a sphere).
On the other hand, `centroid' alignment should never fail, can handle a
large number of points, and can be used in cases of 2D and 1D
degeneracy.
centroid alignment is frequently used as a pre-processing step for more
advanced algorithms.
The `PCA' option finds an Affine transformation by performing centroid
alignment, performing principle component analysis (PCA) separately on
the reference and moving point clouds, computing third-order point
distribution moments along each principle axis to establish a consistent
orientation, and then rotates the moving point cloud so the principle
axes of the stationary and moving point clouds coincide.
The `PCA' method may be suitable when: (1) both clouds are not
contaminated with extra noise points (but some Gaussian noise in the
form of point `jitter' should be tolerated) and (2) the clouds are not
perfectly spherical (i.e., so they have valid principle components).
However, note that the `PCA' method is susceptible to outliers and can
not scale a point cloud.
The `PCA' method will generally fail when the distribution of points
shifts across the centroid (i.e., comparing reference and moving point
clouds) since the orientation of the components will be inverted,
however 2D degeneracy is handled in a 3D-consistent way, and 1D
degeneracy is handled in a 1D-consistent way (i.e, the components
orthogonal to the common line will be completely ambiguous, so spurious
rotations will result).
The `exhaustive_icp' option finds an Affine transformation by first
performing PCA-based alignment and then iteratively alternating between
(1) estimating point-point correspondence and (1) solving for a
least-squares optimal transformation given this correspondence estimate.
`ICP' stands for `iterative closest point.' Each iteration uses the
previous transformation \f[I]only\f[R] to estimate correspondence; a
least-squares optimal linear transform is estimated afresh each
iteration.
The `exhaustive_icp' method is most suitable when both point clouds
consist of approximately 50k points or less.
Beyond this, ICP will still work but runtime scales badly.
ICP is susceptible to outliers and will not scale a point cloud.
It can be used for 2D and 1D degenerate problems, but is not guaranteed
to find the `correct' orientation of degenerate or symmetrical point
clouds.
The `TPS' or Thin-Plate Spline algorithm provides non-rigid (i.e.,
`deformable') registration between corresponding point sets.
The moving and stationary point sets must have the same number of
points, and the \f[I]n\f[R]^th^ moving point is taken to correspond to
the \f[I]n\f[R]^th^ stationary point.
The `TPS' method does not scale well due in part to inversion of a large
(NxN) matrix and is therefore most suitable when both point clouds
consist of approximately 10-20k points or less.
Beyond this, expect slow calculations.
The TPS method is not robust to outliers, however a regularization
parameter can be used to control the smoothness of the warp.
(Setting to zero will cause the warp function to exactly interpolate
every pair, except due to floating point inaccuracies.) Also note that
the TPS method can only, in general, be used for interpolation.
Extrapolation beyond the points clouds will almost certainly result in
wildly inconsistent and unstable transformations.
Consult Bookstein 1989 (doi:10.1109/34.24792) for an overview.
The `TPS-RPM' or Thin-Plate Spline Robust Point-Matching algorithm
provides non-rigid (i.e., `deformable') registration.
It combines a soft-assign technique, deterministic annealing, and
thin-plate splines to iteratively solve for correspondence and spatial
warp.
The `TPS-RPM' method is (somewhat) robust to outliers in both moving and
stationary point sets, but it suffers from numerical instabilities when
one or more inputs are degenerate or symmetric in such a way that many
potential solutions have the same least-square cost.
The `TPS-RPM' method does not scale well due in part to inversion of a
large (NxM) matrix and is therefore most suitable when both point clouds
consist of approximately 1-5k points or less.
Beyond this, expect slow calculations.
Also note that the underlying TPS method can only, in general, be used
for interpolation.
Extrapolation beyond the extent of the corresponding parts of the points
clouds will almost certainly result in wildly inconsistent and unstable
transformations.
Consult Chui and Rangarajan 2000 (original algorithm;
doi:10.1109/CVPR.2000.854733) and Yang 2011 (clarification and more
robust solution; doi:10.1016/j.patrec.2011.01.015) for more details.

Controls whether the extensions for `double sided outlier handling' as

These extensions can improve resilience to outliers, especially in the
moving set.
Yang et al.\ also mention that the inclusion of an extra entropy term in
the cost function can help reduce jitter during the annealing process,
which may result in fewer folds or twists for narrow point clouds.
However, the resulting algorithm is overall less numerically stable and
has a strong dependence on the kernel dimension.
Enabling this parameter adjusts the interpretation of the lambda
regularization parameter, so some fine-tuning may be required.

Controls whether a centroid-based registration is used to seed the

enough freedom to find large-scale deformations (include centroid
alignment).
However, if the initial alignment is intentional, and point cloud
centroids do not align, then seeding the registration will be
detrimental.
Seeding might be useful if the starting temperature is set low (which
will limit large-scale deformations like centroid alignment).

.SS Description
.PP
Forced correspondence between pairs of points (one in the moving set,
one in the stationary set) specified as comma-separated pairs of indices
into the moving and stationary point sets.
Indices are zero-based.
Forced correspondences are taken to be exclusive, meaning that no other
points will correspond with either points.
Forced correspondence also begets outlier rejection, so ensure the
points are not tainted by noise or are outliers.
Note that points can be forced to be treated as outliers by indicating a
non-existent index in the opposite set, such as -1.
Use of forced correspondence may cause the Sinkhorn method to converge
slowly or possibly fail to converge at all.
Increasing the number of Sinkhorn iterations may be required.
Marking points as outliers has ramifications within the algorithm that
can lead to numerical instabilities (especially in the moving point
set).
If possible, it is best to remove known outlier points \f[I]prior\f[R]
to attempting registration.

.SS TPSRPMPermitMovingOutliers
.SS Description
.PP
If enabled, this option permits the TPS-RPM algorithm to automatically
detect and eschew outliers in the moving point set.
A major strength of the TPS-RPM algorithm is that it can handle
outliers, however there are legitimate cases where outliers are known
\f[I]not\f[R] to be present, but the point-to-point correspondence is
\f[I]not\f[R] known.
Note that outlier detection cannot be used when one or more points are
forced to be outliers.
Similar to forced correspondence (i.e., hard constraints), disabling
outlier detection can modify the Sinkhorn algorithm convergence.
Additionally, Sinkhorn normalization is likely to fail when outliers in
the larger point cloud are disallowed.
Note that this parameter is used with the TPS-RPM method, but
\f[I]not\f[R] in the TPS method.

.SS RelativeTolerance
.SS Description
.PP
If the method is iterative, terminate the loop when the cost function
changes between successive iterations by this amount or less.
The magnitude of the cost function will generally depend on the number
of points (in both point clouds), the scale (i.e., `width') of the point
clouds, the amount of noise and outlier points, and any method-specific
parameters that impact the cost function (if applicable); use of this
tolerance parameter may be impacted by these characteristics.
Verifying that a given tolerance is of appropriate magnitude is
recommended.
Relative tolerance checks can be disabled by setting to non-finite or
negative value.
Note that this parameter will only have effect on iterative methods that
are not controlled by, e.g., an annealing schedule.

.SS ExtractRadiomicFeatures
.SS Description
.PP
This operation extracts radiomic features from the selected images.
Features are implemented as per specification in the Image Biomarker
Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) or pyradiomics documentation if the
IBSI specification is unclear or ambiguous.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine is meant to be processed by an external analysis.
.IP \[bu] 2
If this routine is slow, simplifying ROI contours may help speed
surface-mesh-based feature extraction.
Often removing the highest-frequency components of the contour will
help, such as edges that conform tightly to individual voxels.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided

intensity is clamped to the local neighbourhood\[cq]s extrema.
This filter works best for removing spurious peak and trough voxels and
performs no averaging.
A numeric value can also be supplied, which will replace all isolated or

Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ForEachDistinct
.SS Description
.PP
This operation is a control flow meta-operation that partitions all
available data and invokes all child operations once for each distinct
partition.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
If this operation has no children, this operation will evaluate to a
no-op.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation will only partition homogeneous objects, i.e., composite
objects in which all sub-objects share the same set of metadata (e.g.,
image arrays, since each image carries its own metadata).
This guarantees there will be no side-effects due to the partitioning.
For this reason, this operation is most commonly used on high-level
metadata tags that are expected to be uniform across sub-objects.
See the GroupImages operation to permanently partition heterogeneous
image arrays.
.IP \[bu] 2
Each invocation is performed sequentially, and all modifications are
carried forward for each grouping.
However, partitions are generated before any child operations are
invoked, so newly-added elements (e.g., new Image_Arrays) created by one
invocation will not participate in subsequent invocations.
The order of the de-partitioned data is stable, though additional
elements added will follow the partition they were generated from (and
will thus not necessarily be placed at the last element).
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation will most often be used to process data group-wise rather
than as a whole.
.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
KeysCommon
.SS KeysCommon
.SS Description
.PP
Metadata keys to use for exact-match groupings on all data types.
For each partition that is produced, every element will share the same
key-value pair.
This is generally useful for non-numeric (or integer, date, etc.)
key-values.
A `;'-delimited list can be specified to group on multiple criteria
simultaneously.
An empty string disables metadata-based grouping.

.SS GenerateCalibrationCurve
.SS Description
.PP
This operation uses two overlapping images volumes to generate a
calibration curve mapping from the first image volume to the second.
Only the region within the specified ROI(s) is considered.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
ROI(s) are interpretted relative to the mapped-to (`reference' or
`fixed') image.
The reason for this is that typically the reference images are
associated with contours (e.g., planning data) and the mapped-from
images do not (e.g., CBCTs that have been registered).
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine can handle overlapping or duplicate contours.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.
Note that these images are the `mapped-from' or `moving' images.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

.SS Inclusivity
.SS Description
.PP
Controls how voxels are deemed to be `within' the interior of the

The default `center' considers only the central-most point of each
voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.
The second, `planar_corner_exclusive', considers a voxel interior if ALL
(four) corners are interior.

.SS Description
.PP
The orientation unit vector that is aligned with image rows.
Care should be taken to ensure ImageOrientationRow and
ImageOrientationColumn are orthogonal.
(A Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure ensures they are, but the
image orientation may not match the expected orientation.) Note that the
magnitude will also be scaled to unit length for convenience.
Specify coordinates separated by commas.

.SS Transforms
.SS Description
.PP
This parameter is used to specify one or more transformations.
Current primitives include translation, scaling, mirroring, and
rotation.
\[u2022] Translations have three configurable scalar parameters denoting
the translation along x, y, and z in the DICOM coordinate system.
Translating \f[I]x\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1.0,
\f[I]y\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]\[u2005]\[mi]\[u2005]2.0, and
\f[I]z\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]0.3 can be specified as `translate(1.0,
-2.0, 0.3)'.
\[u2022] The scale (actually `homothetic') transformation has four
configurable scalar parameters denoting the scale centre 3-vector and
the magnification factor.
Note that the magnification factor can be negative, which will cause the
mesh to be inverted along x, y, and z axes and magnified.
Take note that face orientations will also become inverted.
Magnifying by 2.7x about
(1.23,\[u2006]\[u2005]\[mi]\[u2005]2.34,\[u2006]3.45) can be specified
as `scale(1.23, -2.34, 3.45, 2.7)'.
A standard scale transformation can be achieved by taking the centre to
be the origin.
\[u2022] The mirror transformation has six configurable scalar
parameters denoting an oriented plane about which a mirror is performed.
Mirroring in the plane that intersects (1,\[u2006]2,\[u2006]3) and has a
normal toward (1,\[u2006]0,\[u2006]0) can be specified as `mirror(1,2,3,
1,0,0)'.
\[u2022] Rotations around an arbitrary axis line can be accomplished.
The rotation transformation has seven configurable scalar parameters
denoting the rotation centre 3-vector, the rotation axis 3-vector, and
the rotation angle in radians.
A rotation of pi radians around the axis line parallel to vector
(1.0,\[u2006]0.0,\[u2006]0.0) that intersects the point
(4.0,\[u2006]5.0,\[u2006]6.0) can be specified as `rotate(4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.141592653)'.
\[u2022] A transformation can be composed of one or more primitive
transformations applied sequentially.
Primitives can be separated by a `;' and are evaluated from left to
right.

.SS GroupImages
.SS Description
.PP
This operation will group individual image slices into partitions
(Image_Arrays) based on the values of the specified metadata tags.
DICOMautomaton operations are usually performed on containers rather
than individual images, and grouping can express connections between
images.
For example a group could contain the scans belonging to a whole study,
one of the series in a study, individual image volumes within a single
series (e.g., a 3D volume in a temporal perfusion scan), or individual
slices.
A group could also contain all the slices that intersect a given plane,
or were taken on a specified StationName.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Images are moved, not copied.
.IP \[bu] 2
Image order within a group is retained (i.e., stable grouping), but
groups are appended to the back of the Image_Array list according to the
default sort for the group\[cq]s key-value value.
.IP \[bu] 2
Images that do not contain the specified metadata will be grouped into a
special N/A group at the end.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').

.SS Description
.PP
Other specialized grouping operations that involve custom logic.
Currently, only `no-overlap' is available, but it has two variants.
Both partition based on the spatial extent of images; in each
non-overlapping partition, no two images will spatially overlap.
`No-overlap-as-is' will effectively insert partitions without altering
the order.
A partition is inserted when an image is found to overlap with an image
already within the partition.
For this grouping to be useful, images must be sorted so that partitions
can be inserted without any necessary reordering.
An example of when this grouping is useful is CT shuttling in which the
ordering of images alternate between increasing and decreasing
SliceNumber.
Note that, depending on the ordering, some partitions may therefore be
incomplete.
`No-overlap-adjust' will rearrange images so that the first partition is
always complete.
This is achieved by building a queue of spatially-overlapping images and
greedily stealing one of each kind when constructing partitions.
An example of when this grouping is useful are 4DCTs which have been
acquired for all phases while the couch remains at a single SliceNumber;
the images are ordered on disk in the acquisition order (i.e., alike
SliceNumbers are bunched together) but the logical analysis order is
that each contiguous volume should represent a single phase.
An empty string disables logic-based grouping.

.SS HighlightROIs
.SS Description
.PP
This operation overwrites voxel data inside and/or outside of ROI(s) to
create an image representation of a set of contours.
It can handle overlapping or duplicate contours.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
The `receding_squares' implementation uses a simplistic one-pass
approach that only considers only the immediate left and immediate up
neighbours to determine the necessary intensity of the (*this) voxel.
The intensity is over-specified, so in general will result in the exact
intensity needed to exactly reproduce the original contours.
Slight differences can arise do to averaging and numerical imprecision,
especially if the input comes from a marching algorithm (common!) which
can result in geometrical alignment and degenerate voxel inclusions.
The `receding_squares' implementation was developed with the
expectations that: (1) the entire image will be overwritten, (2)
contours are accurate and selective, so that ContourOverlap should be
either `honour_opposite_orientations' or `overlapping_contours_cancel',
and that (3) the contour detail and image grid resolution are
sufficiently matched that it is uncommon for multiple contours to pass
between adjacent voxels.
For expectation (2), using `overlapping_contours_cancel' produces the
best results, since all contours will be recreated as much as possible.
Expectation (3) could significantly impact round-trip contour accuracy,
so consider using high-resolution images and, if possible, avoid
pathological contours (e.g., multiple colinear contours separated by
small distances).
.IP \[bu] 2
The `receding_squares' method works best when all values (interior and
exterior) can be overwritten.
This affords the most control and gives the most accurate results.
If some values cannot be overwritten, the algorithm will try to account
for the loss of freedom, but may be too constrained.
If this is necessary, consider providing a large voxel value range.
.IP \[bu] 2
Inclusivity option does not apply to the `receding_squares' method.
.IP \[bu] 2

.SS Description
.PP

Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
This will effectively honour only the outermost contour regardless of
orientation, but provides the most predictable and consistent results.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
This is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
If contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours intersect)
the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and
alternately cancerls all overlapping contours.
Again, if the contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours
intersect) the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.

.SS InterpolateSlices
.SS Description
.PP
This operation interpolates the slices of an image array using a
reference image array, effectively performing trilinear interpolation.
This operation is meant to prepare image arrays to be compared or
operated on in a per-voxel manner.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
No images are overwritten by this operation.
The outgoing images will inherit (interpolated) voxel values from the
selected images and image geometry from the reference images.
.IP \[bu] 2
If all images (selected and reference, altogether) are detected to be
rectilinear, this operation will avoid in-plane interpolation and will
thus be much faster.
There is no \f[B]need\f[R] for rectilinearity, however without it
sections of the image that cannot reasonably be interpolated (via
plane-orthogonal projection onto the reference images) will be invalid
and marked with NaNs.
Non-rectilearity which amounts to a differing number of rows or columns
will merely be slower to interpolate.

`Conservative' refers to the so-called conservative filter that
suppresses isolated peaks; for every voxel considered, the voxel
intensity is clamped to the local neighbourhood\[cq]s extrema.
This filter works best for removing spurious peak and trough voxels and
performs no averaging.
A numeric value can also be supplied, which will replace all isolated or
well-connected voxels.

.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
ImageSelection
.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

Note that a single surface mesh may hold many disconnected mesh
components; they should collectively represent a single logically
cohesive object.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated sub-meshes
together in a single mesh.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth surface
mesh (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last surface mesh.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the surface mesh composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all surface mesh that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous surface mesh
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ModelIVIM
.SS Description
.PP
This operation fits an Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model to a
series of diffusion-weighted MR images.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Images are overwritten, but their geometry is used to define the final
map.
ReferenceImages are used for modeling, but are treated as read-only.
ReferenceImages should correspond to unique b-values, one b-value per
ReferenceImages array.
.IP \[bu] 2
The reference image array must be rectilinear.
(This is a requirement specific to this implementation, a less
restrictive implementation could overcome the issue.)
.IP \[bu] 2
For the fastest and most accurate results, test and reference image
arrays should spatially align.
However, alignment is \f[B]not\f[R] necessary.
If test and reference image arrays are aligned, image adjacency can be
precomputed and the analysis will be faster.
If not, image adjacency must be evaluated for each image slice.
If this also fails, it will be evaluated for every voxel.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation will make use of interpolation if corresponding voxels do
not exactly overlap.

The `adc-simple' model does not take into account perfusion, only free
diffusion is modeled.
It only uses the minimum and maximum b-value images and analytically
estimates ADC.
The `adc-ls' model, like `adc-simple', only models free diffusion.
It fits a linear least-squares models that uses all available b-value
images.
The `kurtosis' model returns 5 parameters corresponding to a
biexponential diffsion model with a Kurtosis adjustment, as well as a
noise floor parameter added in quadrature with the model.
The `biexp' model uses a segmented fitting approach along with
Marquardts method to fit a biexponential decay model, obtaining the
pseudodiffusion fraction, pseudodiffusion coefficient, and diffusion
coefficient for each voxel.

.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS SliceThickness
.SS Description
.PP
Image slices will be have this thickness (in DICOM units: mm).
For most purposes, SliceThickness should be equal to
SpacingBetweenSlices.
If SpacingBetweenSlices is smaller than SliceThickness, images will
overlap.
If SpacingBetweenSlices is larger than SliceThickness, there will be a
gap between images.
Updating the SliceThickness or image positioning using this operation
will alter the image, but will not update SpacingBetweenSlices.
This gives the user freedom to alter all image planes individually,
allowing construction of non-rectilinear image volumes.
If SpacingBetweenSlices is known and consistent, it should be reflected
in the image metadata (by the user).

.SS Method
.SS Description
.PP
Controls the specific type of normalization that will be applied.
`Stretch01' will rescale the voxel values so the minima are 0 and the
maxima are 1.
Likewise, `stretch11' will rescale such that the minima are -1 and the
maxima are 1.
Clamp will ensure all voxel intensities are within [0:1] by setting
those lower than 0 to 0 and those higher than 1 to 1.
(Voxels already within [0:1] will not be altered.) `Sum-to-zero' will
shift all voxels so that the sum of all voxel intensities is zero.
(This is useful for convolution kernels.)

.SS OptimizeStaticBeams
.SS Description
.PP
This operation takes dose matrices corresponding to single, static RT
beams and attempts to optimize beam weighting to create an optimal plan
subject to various criteria.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine is a simplisitic routine that attempts to estimate the
optimal beam weighting.
It should NOT be used for clinical purposes, except maybe as a secondary
check or a means to guess reasonable beam weights prior to optimization
within the clinical TPS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Because beam weights are (generally) not specified in DICOM RTDOSE
files, the beam weights are assumed to all be 1.0.
If they are not all 1.0, the weights reported here will be relative to
whatever the existing weights are.
.IP \[bu] 2
If no PTV ROI is available, the BODY contour may suffice.
If this is not available, dose outside the body should somehow be set to
zero to avoid confusing D_{max} metrics.
For example, bolus D_{max} can be high, but is ultimately irrelevant.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, this routine uses all available images.
This may be fixed in a future release.
Patches are welcome.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Description
.PP
The maximum number of voxels to randomly sample (deterministically)

.SS LineSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more line samples.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth line
sample (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last line sample.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the line sample composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all line sample that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous line sample
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS PointSeparation
.SS Description
.PP
This operation estimates the minimum and maximum point-to-point
separation between two point clouds.
It also computes the longest-nearest (Hausdorff) separation, i.e., the
length of the longest lines from points in selection A to the nearest
point in selection B.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine scales like
\f[I]O\f[R](\f[I]N\f[R]\[u2005]*\[u2005]\f[I]M\f[R]) where \f[I]N\f[R]
and \f[I]M\f[R] are the number of points in each point cloud.
No indexing or acceleration is used.
Beware that large point clouds will result in slow computations.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation can be used to compare points clouds that are nearly
alike.
Such comparisons are useful for quantifying discrepancies after
transformations, reconstructions, simplifications, or any other
scenarios where a point cloud must be reasonable accurately reproduced.

.SS PointSelectionA
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more point clouds.
Note that point clouds can hold a variety of data with varying
attributes, but each point cloud is meant to represent a single
logically cohesive collection of points.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated points together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth point
cloud (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last point cloud.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.

.SS NormalizedROILabelRegex
.SS Description
.PP
A regular expression (regex) matching \f[I]normalized\f[R] ROI contour
labels/names to consider.
.PP
Selection is performed on a whole-ROI basis; individual contours cannot
be selected.
Be aware that input spaces are trimmed to a single space.
If your ROI name has more than two sequential spaces, use regular
expressions or escaping to avoid them.
All ROIs you want to select must match the provided (single) regex, so
use boolean or (`|') if needed.
The regular expression engine is extended POSIX and is case insensitive.
\[cq].*\[cq] will match all available ROIs.
.PP
Note that this parameter will match contour labels that have been
\f[I]normalized\f[R] (i.e., mapped, translated) using the user-provided
provided lexicon.
This is useful for handling data with heterogeneous naming conventions
where fuzzy matching is required.
Refer to the lexicon for available labels.

are ignored (and thus will not be purged, i.e., a denylist).
If true, this operation only considers the \f[I]complement\f[R] of

.SS RankPixels
.SS Description
.PP
This operation ranks pixels throughout an image array.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine operates on all images in an image array, so pixel value
ranks are valid throughout the array.
However, the window and level of each window is separately determined.
You will need to set a uniform window and level manually if desired.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine operates on all images in an image array.
If images need to be processed individually, arrays will have to be
exploded prior to calling this routine.
Note that if this functionality is required, it can be implemented as an
operation option easily.
Likewise, if multiple image arrays must be considered simultaneously,
they will need to be combined before invoking this operation.

.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ReduceNeighbourhood
.SS Description
.PP
This routine walks the voxels of a 3D rectilinear image collection,
reducing the distribution of voxels within the local volumetric
neighbourhood to a scalar value, and updating the voxel value with this
scalar.
This routine can be used to implement mean and median filters (amongst
others) that operate over a variety of 3D neighbourhoods.
Besides purely statistical reductions, logical reductions can be
applied.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
The provided image collection must be rectilinear.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation can be used to compute core 3D morphology operations
(erosion and dilation) as well as composite operations like opening
(i.e., erosion followed by dilation), closing (i.e., dilation followed
by erosion), `gradient' (i.e., the difference between dilation and
erosion, which produces an outline), and various other combinations of
core and composite operations.

.SS Neighbourhood
.SS Description

Variable-size neighbourhoods `spherical' and `cubic' are defined.
An appropriate isotropic extent must be provided for these
neighbourhoods.
(See below; extents must be provided in DICOM units, i.e., mm.)
Fixed-size neighbourhoods specify a fixed number of adjacent voxels.
Fixed rectagular neighbourhoods are specified like `RxCxI' for row,
column, and image slice extents (as integer number of rows, columns, and
slices).
Fixed spherical neighbourhoods are specified like `Wsphere' where W is
the width (i.e., the number of voxels wide).
In morphological terminology, the neighbourhood is referred to as a
`structuring element.' A similar concept is the convolutional `kernel.'

.SS Reduction
.SS Description
.PP
Controls how the distribution of voxel values from neighbouring voxels
is reduced.
Statistical distribution reducers `min', `mean', `median', and `max' are
defined.
`min' is also known as the `erosion' operation.
Likewise, `max' is also known as the `dilation' operation.
Note that the morphological `opening' operation can be accomplished by
sequentially performing an erosion and then a dilation using the same
neighbourhood.
The `standardize' reduction method can be used for adaptive rescaling by
subtracting the local neighbourhood mean and dividing the local
neighbourhood standard deviation.
The `standardize' reduction method is a way to (locally) transform
variables on different scales so they can more easily be compared.
Note that standardization can result in undefined voxel values when the
local neighbourhood is perfectly uniform.
Also, since only the local neighbourhood is considered, voxels will in
general have \f[I]neither\f[R] zero mean \f[I]nor\f[R] a unit standard
deviation (growing the neighbourhood extremely large \f[I]will\f[R]
accomplish this, but the calculation will be inefficient).
The `percentile01' reduction method evaluates which percentile the
central voxel occupies within the local neighbourhood.
It is reported scaled to [0,\[u2006]1].
`percentile01' can be used to implement non-parametric adaptive scaling
since only the local neighbourhood is examined.
(Duplicate values assume the percentile of the middle of the range.) In
contrast to `standardize', the `percentile01' reduction should remain
valid anywhere the local neighbourhood has a non-zero number of finite
voxels.
Logical reducers `is_min' and `is_max' are also available \[en] is_min
(is_max) replace the voxel value with 1.0 if it was the min (max) in the
neighbourhood and 0.0 otherwise.
Logical reducers `is_min_nan' and `is_max_nan' are variants that replace
the voxel with a NaN instead of 1.0 and otherwise do not overwrite the
original voxel value.

For spherical neighbourhoods, this distance refers to the radius.
For cubic neighbourhoods, this distance refers to `box radius' or the
distance from the cube centre to the nearest point on each bounding
face.

Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth surface
mesh (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last surface mesh.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the surface mesh composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all surface mesh that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous surface mesh
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Description
.PP
This operation is a control flow meta-operation that repeatedly and
sequentially invokes all child operations the given number of times.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
If this operation has no children, this operation will evaluate to a
no-op.
.IP \[bu] 2
Each repeat is performed sequentially, and all side-effects are carried
forward for each iteration.
In particular, all selectors in child operations are evaluated lazily,
at the moment when the child operation is invoked.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation will most often be used to repeat operations that compose
naturally, such as repeatedly applying a small Gaussian filter to
simulate a single Gaussian filter with a large kernel, iteratively
refining a calculation, loading multiple copies of the same file, or
attempting a given analysis while waiting for data from a remote server.

The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
The latter is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and cancels
all contour overlap.

.SS SeamContours
.SS Description
.PP
This routine converts contours that represent `outer' and `inner' via
contour orientation into contours that are uniformly outer but have a
zero-area seam connecting the inner and outer portions.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine currently operates on all available ROIs.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine operates on one contour_collection at a time.
It will combine contours that are in the same contour_collection and
overlap, even if they have different ROINames.
Consider making a complementary routine that partitions contours into
ROIs based on ROIName (or other metadata) if more rigorous enforcement
is needed.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine actually computes the XOR Boolean of contours that overlap.
So if contours partially overlap, this routine will treat the
overlapping parts as if they are holes, and the non-overlapping parts as
if they represent the ROI.
This behaviour may be surprising in some cases.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will also treat overlapping contours with like orientation
as if the smaller contour were a hole of the larger contour.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will ignore contour orientation if there is only a single
contour.
More specifically, for a given ROI label, planes with a single contour
will be unaltered.
.IP \[bu] 2
Only the common metadata between outer and inner contours is propagated
to the seamed contours.
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine will NOT combine disconnected contours with a seam.
Disconnected contours will remain disconnected.

.SS SimplificationMethod
.SS Description
.PP
The specific algorithm used to perform contour simplification.
`Vertex removal' is a simple algorithm that removes vertices one-by-one
without replacement.
It iteratively ranks vertices and removes the single vertex that has the
least impact on contour area.
It is best suited to removing redundant vertices or whenever new
vertices should not be added.
`Vertex collapse' combines two adjacent vertices into a single vertex at
their midpoint.
It iteratively ranks vertex pairs and removes the single vertex that has
the least total impact on contour area.
Note that small sharp features that alternate inward and outward will
have a small total area cost, so will be pruned early.
Thus this technique acts as a low-pass filter and will defer
simplification of high-curvature regions until necessary.
It is more economical compared to vertex removal in that it will usually
simplify contours more for a given tolerance (or, equivalently, can
retain contour fidelity better than vertex removal for the same number
of vertices).
However, vertex collapse performs an averaging that may result in
numerical imprecision.

.SS SimplifySurfaceMeshes
.SS Description

This operation performs mesh simplification on existing surface meshes
according to the specified criteria, replacing the original meshes with
simplified copies.

.SS MeshSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more surface meshes.
Note that a single surface mesh may hold many disconnected mesh
components; they should collectively represent a single logically
cohesive object.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated sub-meshes
together in a single mesh.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth surface
mesh (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last surface mesh.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the surface mesh composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all surface mesh that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous surface mesh
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS SimulateRadiograph
.SS Description
.PP
This routine uses ray marching and volumetric sampling to simulate
radiographs using a CT image array.
Voxels are assumed to have intensities in HU.
A simplisitic conversion from CT number (in HU) to relative electron
density (see note below) is performed for marched rays.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Images must be regular.
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation currently takes a simplistic approach and should only be
used for purposes where the simulated radiograph contrast can be tuned
and validated (e.g., in a relative way).
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation assumes mass density (in g/cm^3^) and relative electron
density (dimensionless; relative to electron density of water, which is
3.343\f[I]E\f[R]23 cm^3^) are numerically equivalent.
This assumption appears to be reasonable for bulk human tissue
(arXiv:1508.00226v1).

marching.
Adjusting this parameter will alter the radiograph image contrast the
exponential attenuation model; numbers within (0:1) will result in less
attenuation, whereas numbers within (1:inf) will result in more
attenuation.
Thin or low-mass subjects might require artifically increased
attenuation, whereas thick or high-mass subjects might require
artifically decreased attenuation.
Setting this number to 1 will result in no scaling.
This parameter has units 1/length, and the magnitude should
\f[I]roughly\f[R] correspond with the inverse of about 3\[tmu] the
length transited by a typical ray (in mm).

.SS ImageModel
.SS Description
.PP
This parameter adjusts how the final image is constructed.
As rays transit a voxel, the approximate transit distance is multiplied
with the voxel\[cq]s attenuation coefficient (i.e.,
\f[I]\[*m]\f[R]\[u2005]\[md]\[u2005]\f[I]d\f[R]\f[I]L\f[R]) to give the
ray\[cq]s attenuation.
The sum of all per-voxel attenuations constitutes the total attenuation.
There are many ways this information can be converted into an image.
First, the `attenuation-length' model directly outputs the total
attenuation for each ray.
The simulated image\[cq]s pixels will contain the total attenuation for
one ray.
It will almost always provide an image since the attenutation is not
performed.
This can be thought of as a log transform of a standard radiograph.
Second, the `exponential' model performs the attenuation assuming the
radiation beam is monoenergetic, narrow, and has the same energy
spectrum as the original imaging device.
This model produces a typical radiograph, where each image pixel
contains
1\[u2005]\[mi]\[u2005]exp\[u2006]\[u2005]\[mi]\[u2005]\[sum]\f[I]\[*m]\f[R]\[u2005]\[md]\[u2005]\f[I]d\f[R]\f[I]L\f[R].
Note that the values will all \[u2004]\[mo]\[u2004][0\[u2004]:\[u2004]1]
(i.e., Hounsfield units are \f[I]not\f[R] used).
The overall contrast can be adjusted using the AttenuationScale
parameter, however it is easiest to assess a reasonable tuning factor by
inspecting the image produced by the `attenutation-length' model.

parameter that controls the number of adjacent pixels to consider.
The former (`\&...3x3' and `\&...5x5') are `fixed' estimators that use a
convolution kernel with a fixed size (3x3 or 5x5 pixel neighbourhoods).
All estimators operate in `pixel-space' and are ignorant about the image
spatial extent.
All estimators are normalized, and thus won\[cq]t significantly affect

.SS MeshSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more surface meshes.
Note that a single surface mesh may hold many disconnected mesh
components; they should collectively represent a single logically
cohesive object.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated sub-meshes
together in a single mesh.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth surface
mesh (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last surface mesh.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the surface mesh composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all surface mesh that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous surface mesh
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed

.SS ZSelection
.SS Description
.PP
The thickness and offset defining the single, continuous extent of the
sub-segmentation in terms of the fractional area remaining above a
plane.
The planes define the portion extracted and are determined such that
sub-segmentation will give the desired fractional planar areas.
The numbers specify the thickness and offset from the bottom of the ROI
volume to the bottom of the extent.
The `upper' direction is take from the contour plane orientation and
assumed to be positive if pointing toward the positive-z direction.
Only a single 3D selection can be made per operation invocation.
Sub-segmentation can be performed in transverse (`Z'), row_unit (`X'),
and column_unit (`Y') directions (in that order).
All selections are defined in terms of the original ROIs.
Note that impossible selections will likely result in errors, e.g.,
specifying a small constraint when the .
Note that it is possible to perform nested sub-segmentation (including
passing along the original contours) by opting to replace the original
ROI contours with this sub-segmentation and invoking this operation
again with the desired sub-segmentation.
Examples: If you want the middle 50% of an ROI, specify `0.50;0.25'.
If you want the upper 50% then specify `0.50;0.50'.
If you want the lower 50% then specify `0.50;0.0'.
If you want the upper 30% then specify `0.30;0.70'.
If you want the lower 30% then specify `0.30;0.70'.

.SS SubsegMethod
.SS Description
.PP
The method to use for sub-segmentation.
Nested sub-segmentation should almost always be preferred unless you
know what you\[cq]re doing.
It should be faster too.
The compound method was used in the van Luijk paper, but it is known to
have serious problems.

.SS ZSelection
.SS Description
.PP
The thickness and offset defining the single, continuous extent of the
sub-segmentation in terms of the fractional area remaining above a
plane.
The planes define the portion extracted and are determined such that
sub-segmentation will give the desired fractional planar areas.
The numbers specify the thickness and offset from the bottom of the ROI
volume to the bottom of the extent.
The `upper' direction is take from the contour plane orientation and
assumed to be positive if pointing toward the positive-z direction.
Only a single 3D selection can be made per operation invocation.
Sub-segmentation can be performed in transverse (\[lq]Z\[rq]), row_unit
(\[lq]X\[rq]), and column_unit (\[lq]Y\[rq]) directions (in that order).
All selections are defined in terms of the original ROIs.
Note that it is possible to perform nested sub-segmentation (including
passing along the original contours) by opting to replace the original
ROI contours with this sub-segmentation and invoking this operation
again with the desired sub-segmentation.
If you want the middle 50% of an ROI, specify `0.50;0.25'.
If you want the upper 50% then specify `0.50;0.50'.
If you want the lower 50% then specify `0.50;0.0'.
If you want the upper 30% then specify `0.30;0.70'.
If you want the lower 30% then specify `0.30;0.70'.

.SS FractionalTolerance
.SS Description
.PP
The tolerance of X, Y, and Z fractional area bisection criteria (see

This parameter specifies a stopping condition for the bisection
procedure.
If it is set too high, sub-segments may be inadequatly rough.
If it is set too low, bisection below the machine precision floor may be
attempted, which will result in instabilities.
Note that the number of permitted iterations will control whether this
tolerance can possibly be reached; if strict adherence is required, set
the maximum number of iterations to be excessively large.

.SS SubtractImages
.SS Description
.PP
This routine subtracts images that spatially overlap.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
The ReferenceImageSelection is subtracted from the ImageSelection and
the result is stored in ImageSelection.
So this operation implements
\f[I]A\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]\f[I]A\f[R]\[u2005]\[mi]\[u2005]\f[I]B\f[R]
where A is ImageSelection and B is ReferenceImageSelection.
The ReferenceImageSelection images are not altered.
.IP \[bu] 2
Multiple image volumes can be selected by both ImageSelection and
ReferenceImageSelection.
For each ImageSelection volume, each of the ReferenceImageSelection
volumes are subtracted sequentially.
.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
ImageSelection
.IP \[bu] 2
ReferenceImageSelection
.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS SurfaceBasedRayCastDoseAccumulate
.SS Description
.PP
This routine uses rays (actually: line segments) to estimate point-dose
on the surface of an ROI.
The ROI is approximated by surface mesh and rays are passed through.
Dose is interpolated at the intersection points and intersecting lines
(i.e., where the ray `glances' the surface) are discarded.
The surface reconstruction can be tweaked, but appear to reasonably
approximate the ROI contours; both can be output to compare visually.
Though it is not required by the implementation, only the ray-surface
intersection nearest to the detector is considered.
All other intersections (i.e., on the far side of the surface mesh) are
ignored.
This routine is fairly fast compared to the slow grid-based counterpart
previously implemented.
The speedup comes from use of an AABB-tree to accelerate intersection
queries and avoid having to `walk' rays step-by-step through
over/through the geometry.

.SS MeshingSubdivisionIterations
.SS Description
.PP
The number of iterations of Loop\[cq]s subdivision to apply to the
surface mesh.
The aim of subdivision in this context is to have a smooth surface to
work with, but too many applications will create too many facets.
More facets will not lead to more precise results beyond a certain
(modest) amount of smoothing.
If the geometry is relatively spherical already, and meshing bounds
produce reasonably smooth (but `blocky') surface meshes, then 2-3
iterations should suffice.
More than 3-4 iterations will almost always be inappropriate.

.SS MaxRaySurfaceIntersections
.SS Description
.PP
The maximum number of ray-surface intersections to accumulate before
retiring each ray.
Note that intersections are sorted spatially by their distance to the
detector, and those closest to the detector are considered first.
If the ROI surface is opaque, setting this value to 1 will emulate
visibility.
Setting to 2 will permit rays continue through the ROI and pass through
the other side; dose will be the accumulation of dose at each
ray-surface intersection.
This value should most often be 1 or some very high number (e.g., 1000)
to make the surface either completely opaque or completely transparent.
(A transparent surface may help to visualize geometrical `folds' or
other surface details of interest.)

.SS ThresholdImages
.SS Description
.PP
This operation applies thresholds to images.
Both upper and lower thresholds can be specified.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This routine operates on individual images.
When thresholds are specified on a percentile basis, each image is
considered separately and therefore each image may be thresholded with
different values.
.IP \[bu] 2
Both thresholds are inclusive.
To binarize an image, use the same threshold for both upper and lower
threshold parameters.
Voxels that fall on the threshold will currently be treated as if they
exclusively satisfy the upper threshold, but this behaviour is not
guaranteed.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP

Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a

time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').

.SS ThresholdOtsu
.SS Description
.PP
This routine performs Otsu thresholding (i.e., `binarization') on an
image volume.
The thresholding is limited within ROI(s).
Otsu thresholding works best on images with a well-defined bimodal voxel
intensity histogram.
It works by finding the threshold that partitions the voxel intensity
histogram into two parts, essentially so that the sum of each
partition\[cq]s variance is minimal.
The number of histogram bins (i.e., number of distinct voxel magnitude
levels) is configurable.
Voxels are binarized; the replacement values are also configurable.
.SS Notes

The Otsu method will not necessarily cleanly separate bimodal peaks in
the voxel intensity histogram.

.SS HistogramBins
.SS Description
.PP
The number of equal-width bins the histogram should have.
Classically, images were 8-bit integer-valued and thus 255 bins were
commonly used.
However, because floating-point numbers are used practically any number
of bins are supported.
What is optimal (or acceptable) depends on the analytical requirements.
If the threshold does not have to be exact, try use the smallest number
of bins you can get away with; 50-150 should suffice.
This will speed up computation.
If the threshold is being used for analytical purposes, use as many bins
as the data can support \[en] if the voxel values span only 8-bit
integers, having more than 255 bins will not improve the analysis.
Likewise if voxels are discretized or sparse.
Experiment by gradually increasing the number of bins until the
threshold value converges to a reasonable number, and then use that
number of bins for future analysis.

.SS TrimROIDose
.SS Description
.PP
This operation provides a simplified interface for overriding the dose
within a ROI.
For example, this operation can be used to modify a base plan by
eliminating dose that coincides with a PTV/CTV/GTV/ROI etc.
.SS Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
This operation performs the opposite of the `Crop' operation, which
trims the dose outside a ROI.
.IP \[bu] 2
The inclusivity of a dose voxel that straddles the ROI boundary can be
specified in various ways.
Refer to the Inclusivity parameter documentation.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default this operation only overrides dose within a ROI.
The opposite, overriding dose outside of a ROI, can be accomplished
using the expert interface.

.SS ImageSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS ContourOverlap
.SS Description
.PP
Controls overlapping contours are treated.
The default `ignore' treats overlapping contours as a single contour,
regardless of contour orientation.
This will effectively honour only the outermost contour regardless of
orientation, but provides the most predictable and consistent results.
The option `honour_opposite_orientations' makes overlapping contours
with opposite orientation cancel.
Otherwise, orientation is ignored.
This is useful for Boolean structures where contour orientation is
significant for interior contours (holes).
If contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours intersect)
the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.
The option `overlapping_contours_cancel' ignores orientation and
alternately cancerls all overlapping contours.
Again, if the contours do not have consistent overlap (e.g., if contours
intersect) the results can be unpredictable and hard to interpret.

the original contours.

.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more image arrays.
Note that image arrays can hold anything, but will typically represent a
single contiguous 3D volume (i.e., a volumetric CT scan) or `4D'
time-series.
Be aware that it is possible to mix logically unrelated images together.
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth image
array (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last image array.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the image array composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all image array that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous image array
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SS Inclusivity
.SS Description
.PP
Controls how voxels are deemed to be `within' the interior of the
selected ROI(s).
The default `center' considers only the central-most point of each
voxel.
There are two corner options that correspond to a 2D projection of the
voxel onto the image plane.
The first, `planar_corner_inclusive', considers a voxel interior if ANY
corner is interior.
The second, `planar_corner_exclusive', considers a voxel interior if ALL
(four) corners are interior.

.SS TransformSelection
.SS Description
.PP
Select one or more transform objects (aka `warp' objects).
Selection specifiers can be of three types: positional, metadata-based
key\[at]value regex, and intrinsic.
.PP
Positional specifiers can be `first', `last', `none', or `all' literals.
Additionally `#N' for some positive integer N selects the Nth
transformation (with zero-based indexing).
Likewise, `#-N' selects the Nth-from-last transformation.
Positional specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
.PP
Metadata-based key\[at]value expressions are applied by matching the
keys verbatim and the values with regex.
In order to invert metadata-based selectors, the regex logic must be
inverted (i.e., you can \f[I]not\f[R] prefix metadata-based selectors
with a `!').
Note regexes are case insensitive and should use extended POSIX syntax.
.PP
Intrinsic specifiers are currently limited to the `numerous' and
`fewest' literals, which selects the transformation composed of the
greatest and fewest number of sub-objects.
Intrinsic specifiers can be inverted by prefixing with a `!'.
Note that `!numerous' means all transformation that do not have the
greatest number of sub-objects, not the least-numerous transformation
(i.e., `fewest').
.PP
All criteria (positional, metadata, and intrinsic) can be mixed
together.
Multiple criteria can be specified by separating them with a `;' and are
applied in the order specified.

.SH Known Issues and Limitations
.SS Hanging on Debian
.PP
The SFML_Viewer operation hangs on some systems after viewing a plot
with Gnuplot.
This stems from a known issue in Ygor.
.SS Build Requirements
.PP
DICOMautomaton depends on several heavily templated libraries and
external projects.
It requires a considerable amount of memory to build.
.SS DICOM-RT Support Incomplete
.PP
Support for the DICOM Radiotherapy extensions are limited.
In particular, only RTDOSE files can currently be exported, and RTPLAN
files are not supported at all.
Read support for DICOM image modalities and RTSTRUCTS are generally
supported well.
Broader DICOM support is planned for a future release.
