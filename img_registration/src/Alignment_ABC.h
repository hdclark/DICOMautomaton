// numbers and an algorithm that can make sense of the numbers. For example, a polynomial can be split into a set of
// coefficients and a generic algorithm that can be evaluated for any set of coefficients. Another example is a
// matrix, say an Affine matrix, which we can write to a file as a set of coefficients that can be applied to the
// positions of each point.
